      "content": "The planets of our solar system all revolve around the Sun in the same direction and \nin orbits that lie in nearly the same plane. This is strong evidence that the planets \nformed simultaneously from a single disk of material that rotated in the same \ndirection as the modern planets. \nPrecisely when the planets came into being has been a difficult issue to resolve. \nWhile Earth's water is necessary for life, its abundance near the planet's surface \nmakes rapid erosion inevitable. Continuous alteration of the crust by erosion and \nalso by igneous (volcanic) and metamorphic (pressure and heat within Earth) \nprocesses makes unlikely any discovery of rocks nearly as old as Earth. Thus, \ngeologists have had to look beyond this planet in their efforts to date Earth's origin. \nFortunately, we do have samples of rock that appear to represent the primitive \nmaterial of the solar system. These samples are meteorites, which originate as \nextraterrestrial objects, called meteors, that have been captured in Earth's \ngravitational field and have then crashed into our planet. \nSome meteorites consist of rocky material and, accordingly, are called stony \nmeteorites. Others are metallic and have been designated iron meteorites even \nthough they contain lesser amounts of elements other than iron. Still others consist \nof mixtures of rocky and metallic material and thus are called stony-iron meteorites. \nMeteors come in all sizes, from small particles to the small planets known as \nasteroids; no asteroid, however, has struck Earth during recorded human history. \nMany meteorites appear to be fragments of larger bodies that have undergone \ncollisions and broken into pieces. Iron meteorites are fragments of the interiors of \nthese bodies, comparable to Earth's core, and stony meteorites are from outer \nportions of these bodies, comparable to Earth's mantle (the layer between the core \nand outer crust). \nMeteorites have been radiometrically dated by means of several decay systems, \nincluding rubidium-strontium, potassium-argon, and uranium-thorium. The dates thus \nderived tend to cluster around 4.6 billion years, which suggests that this is the \napproximate age of the solar system. After many meteorites had been dated, it was \ngratifying to find that the oldest ages obtained for rocks gathered on the surface of \nthe Moon also were approximately 4.6 billion years. This must, indeed, be the age of \nthe solar system. Ancient rocks can be found on the Moon because the lunar \nsurface, unlike that of Earth, has no water to weather and erode rocks and is \ncharacterized by only weak movements of its crust. \nDetermining the age of the universe has been more complicated. Most stars in the \nuniverse are clustered into enormous disk-like galaxies. The distance between our \ngalaxy, known as the Milky Way, and all others is increasing. In fact, all galaxies are \nmoving away from one another, evidence that the universe is expanding. It is not the \ngalaxies themselves that are expanding but the space between them. What is \nhappening is analogous to inflating a balloon with small coins attached to its surface. \nThe coins behave like galaxies: although they do not expand, the space between \nthem does. Before the galaxies formed, matter that they contain was concentrated \nwith infinite density at a single point from which it exploded in an event called the big \nbang. Even after it assembled into galaxies, matter continued to spread in all \ndirections from the site of the big bang. \nThe evidence that the universe is expanding makes it possible to estimate its age. \nThis evidence, called the redshift, is an increase in the wavelengths of light waves \ntraveling through space—a shift toward the red end of the visible spectrum of \nwavelengths. Expansion of the space between galaxies causes this shift by \nstretching light waves as they pass through it. The farther these light waves have \ntraveled through space, the greater the redshift they have undergone. For this \nreason, light waves that reach Earth from distant galaxies have larger redshifts than \nthose from nearby galaxies. Calculations based on these redshifts indicate that \nabout 13.7 billion years ago all of the galaxies would have been at one spot, the site \nof the big bang. This, then, is the approximate date of the big bang and the age of \nthe universe.",

  "title": "Alaska and Bark Beetles",
  "content": "Over the twentieth century, global temperatures increased by an average of about 0.7 degrees Celsius, but some places have warmed a lot more than this, and other places have warmed less. These temperature increases have been enough to trigger changes in ecosystems all over the world, especially in places where the warming has been the greatest. In some places, the changes have been subtle, perhaps a slight shift in vegetation that only a careful observer would notice. In other cases, small changes in climate have sparked a chain of larger effects, leading to massive changes.\n\nThe biggest climate-caused ecosystem shifts today are happening at the world's most northern latitudes, where the temperature over the last century has been rising about two times faster than the global average. In the northernmost state of the United States, Alaska, for example, warming has paved the way for a spike in the numbers of spruce bark beetles. Bark beetles have been a pest to Alaskan white spruce trees for thousands of years, but their numbers were held in check by the cold climate, which forced the insects to hide in the bark of individual trees for most of the year. As the length of the warm season increased over the 1980s and 1990s, however, bark beetles had more time to fly from one tree to the next, burrow, and lay their eggs between the bark and the wood. The beetles had another thing going for them, too: a multi-year drought had weakened many of the spruce trees, leaving them vulnerable to attack. In the mid-1990s, the bark beetle population exploded, and over the next few years the pests wiped out white spruce forests over an area the size of the U.S. state of Connecticut. In the years since, the combined forces of a longer insect-breeding season and forest management practices that left forests overcrowded gave way to similar epidemics farther south. Large swaths of pine and spruce have been destroyed by insects in several other parts of the United States.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the effects of the bark beetle epidemic rippled throughout Alaska's white spruce ecosystem and affected virtually every population of living organism, but not all of the impacts were negative. Fewer spruce trees meant a sunnier area in the forest below the treetops, which allowed grasses to move in and take hold. The grasses, in turn, changed the soil temperature, making the environment more friendly for some other types of vegetation. Animals that feed on grasses, including moose, elk, and some birds, also benefited. But the beetle infestation was bad news for organisms that rely on white spruce for their habitat, like hawks, owls, red squirrels, and voles. Voles, a type of small, mouse-like rodent, are an especially vital part of the ecosystem because they help spread mycorrhizal fungi, which attach to the roots of plants and help them take in water and nutrients. Voles are also an important food for a number of predators.\n\nEcosystem changes always hurt some living creatures and help others. It's hard to say, therefore, whether a change is good or bad overall. Instead, ecologists (people who study ecosystems) often focus on the impacts on a single species: for instance, us. In the short term, the Alaskan spruce beetle epidemic supplied a lot of people with firewood, but only by destroying tons of otherwise valuable timber and threatening the livelihoods of loggers. And no one knows for sure what the long-term impacts on the forest will be. Ecosystems tend to return to their previous states after disturbances like pest outbreaks, fires, or major storm events, but if the Alaskan spruce ecosystem is disturbed too often or too much, it might shift to a different type of forest, a woodland, or a grassland instead.\n\nIn extreme cases, major assaults on ecosystems can lead to a total collapse in which the ecosystem doesn't bounce back to the way it was or transition to a new, healthy state. The result is an area with very little life; in the oceans, biologists refer to these areas as dead zones. One such example is the coral reef die-off that happened in the Indian Ocean in the late 1990s.",

  "title": "Milankovitch Cycles and Glaciation",
  "content": "Although the history of glaciation during the Pleistocene epoch (2 million to 10,000 years ago) is well established, we do not know with complete certainty why glaciation takes place. For over a century, geologists and climatologists have struggled with this problem, but it remains unsolved.\n\nIt is long known that Earth's orbit around the Sun changes periodically, cyclically affecting the way solar radiation strikes the Earth, but the idea that these changes affect climate was first advanced by James Croll in the late 1800s. Later, Milutin Milankovitch elaborated the theory with calculations that convincingly argued that the cycles, now known as Milankovitch cycles, could cause climatic variations.\n\nThe Milankovitch cycles emerge from the way three cyclic changes in Earth's orbit combine. One characteristic of Earth's orbit is its eccentricity, the degree to which the orbit is an ellipse rather than a circle. Changes in the eccentricity of Earth's orbit occur in a cycle of about 96,000 years. The inclination, or tilt, of Earth's axis also varies periodically, moving between 22 degrees and 24.5 degrees. The tilt of Earth's axis, toward the Sun at some times of the year and away from the Sun at other times, is responsible for the annual cycle of seasons. The greater the tilt, the greater the contrast between summer and winter temperatures. Changes in the tilt occur in a cycle 41,000 years long. Also, Earth wobbles as it spins, like a slightly unsteady top. The wobble cycle is completed once every 21,700 years. Changes in eccentricity, tilt, and wobble do not affect the total amount of solar radiation Earth receives in a year, but they do affect how evenly or unevenly this radiation is disturbed over the course of a year. According to the Milankovitch theory, about every 40,000 years the three separate cycles combine in such a way that the difference between summer and winter temperatures is at a minimum. At this point winter temperatures are milder but so too are summer temperatures. As a result, less ice is melted in the summer than is formed in the winter, so glaciers build up and a period of glaciation results.\n\nMilankovitch worked out the ideas of climatic cycles in the 1920s and 1930s, but it was not until the 1970s that a detailed chronology of the Pleistocene temperature changes was determined that could test the predictions of this theory. A correspondence between Milankovitch cycles and climate fluctuations of the last 65 million years seems clear. Furthermore, studies of rock samples drilled from the deep-sea floor and the fossils contained in them indicate that the fluctuation of climate during the past few hundred thousand years is remarkably close to that predicted by Milankovitch.\n\nA problem with Milankovitch's explanation of glaciation arises from the fact that the variations in Earth's orbit, and hence the Milankovitch cycles, have existed for billions of years. Thus, we might expect that glaciation would have been a cyclic event throughout geologic time. In fact, periods of glaciation are rare. So there must be another factor acting together with the Milankovitch cycles that causes periods of glaciation. Once this additional factor makes the temperature low enough, the cyclic variations of the Milankovitch cycles will force the planet into and out of glacial epochs with a fixed regularity.\n\nMany hypotheses have been proposed for the additional cooling factor. Some suggest that variations in the Sun's energy output could account for the ice ages. However, our present understanding of the Sun's luminosity holds that it should have progressively increased, not decreased, over the course of Earth's history. Still others argue that volcanic dust injected into the atmosphere shields Earth from the Sun's rays and initiates an ice age. However, no correlation has been found between volcanic activity and the start of the last ice age. An increasingly attractive theory holds that decreases in atmospheric carbon dioxide starts the cooling trend that leads to glaciation. Carbon dioxide traps solar energy reflected from the Earth's surface. If carbon dioxide levels decrease, less heat is trapped and Earth's surface cools. Recent studies of the carbon dioxide content of gas bubbles preserved in the Greenland ice cap do in fact show that high carbon dioxide levels are associated with warm interglacial periods, and low levels with cold glacial periods.",

      "title": "Japan's Climate",
      "content": "At the most general level, two major climatic forces determine Japan's weather. \nPrevailing westerly winds move across Eurasia, sweep over the Japanese islands, \nand continue eastward across the Pacific Ocean. In addition, great cyclonic airflows \n(masses of rapidly circulating air) that arise over the western equatorial Pacific move \nin a wheel-like fashion northeastward across Japan and nearby regions. During \nwinter months heavy masses of cold air from Siberia dominate the weather around \nJapan. Persistent cold winds skim across the Sea of Japan from the northwest, \npicking up moisture that they deposit as several feet of snow on the western side of \nthe mountain ranges on Honshu Island. As the cold air drops its moisture, it flows \nover high ridges and down eastern slopes to bring cold, relatively dry weather to \nvalleys and coastal plains and cities. \nIn spring the Siberian air mass warms and loses density, enabling atmosphere \ncurrents over the Pacific to steer warmer air into northeast Asia. This warm, \nmoisture-laden air covers most of southern Japan during June and July. The \nresulting late spring rains then give way to a drier summer that is sufficiently hot and \nmuggy, despite the island chain's northerly latitude, to allow widespread rice \ncultivation. \nSummer heat is followed by the highly unpredictable autumn rains that accompany \nthe violent tropical windstorm known as typhoons. These cyclonic storms originate \nover the western Pacific and travel in great clockwise arcs, initially heading west \ntoward the Philippines and southern China, curving northward later in the season. \nCold weather drives these storms eastward across Japan through early winter to \nrevitalize the Siberian air mass and usher in a new annual weather cycle. \nThis yearly cycle has played a key role in shaping Japanese civilization. It has \nassured the islands ample precipitation, ranging irregularly from more than 200 \ncentimeters annually in parts of the southwest to about 100 in the northeast and \naveraging 180 for the country as a whole. The moisture enables the islands to \nsupport uncommonly lush forest cover, but the combination of precipitous slopes and \nheavy rainfall also gives the islands one of the world's highest rates of natural \nerosion, intensified by both human activity and the natural shocks of earthquakes \nand volcanism. These factors have given Japan its wealth of sedimentary basins, but \nthey have also made mountainsides extremely susceptible to erosion and landslides \nand hence generally unsuitable for agricultural manipulation. \nThe island chain's mountainous backbone and great length from north to south \nproduce climatic diversity that has contributed to regional differences. Generally \nsunny winters along the Pacific seaboard have made habitation there relatively \npleasant. Along the Sea of Japan, on the other hand, cold, snowy winters have \ndiscouraged settlement. Furthermore, although annual precipitation is high in that \nregion, much of it comes as snow and rushes to the sea as spring runoff, leaving \nlittle moisture for farming. \nSummer weather patterns in northern Honshu, and especially along the Sea of \nJapan, have also discouraged agriculture. The area is subject to the yamase effect, \nwhen cool air from the north sometimes lowers temperatures sharply and damages \nfarm production. The impact of this effect has been especially great on rice \ncultivation because, if it is to grow well, the rice grown in Japan requires a mean \nsummer temperature of 20°C centigrade or higher. A drop of 2°—3°C leads to a \n30—50 percent drop in rice yield, and the yamase effect is capable of exceeding that \nlevel. This yamase effect does not, however, extend very far south, where most \nprecipitation comes in the form of rain and the bulk of it in spring, summer, and fall, \nwhen most useful for cultivation. Even the autumn typhoons, which deposit most of \ntheir moisture along the southern seaboard, are beneficial because they promote the \nstart of the winter crops that for centuries have been grown in southern Japan. \nIn short, for the past two millennia, the climate in general and patterns of \nprecipitation in particular have encouraged the Japanese to cluster their settlements \nalong the southern coast, most densely along the sheltered Inland Sea, moving into \nthe northeast. There the limits that topography imposed on production have been \ntightened by climate, with the result that agricultural output has been more modest \nand less reliable, making the risk of crop failure and hardship commensurately \ngreater.",

      "title": "Saving Soil and Cropland",
      "content": "The world's farmers are literally losing ground on two fronts—the loss of soil from \nerosion and the conversion of cropland to nonfarm uses. Both are well-established \ntrends that reduce agricultural output, but since both are gradual processes, they are \noften not given the attention they deserve. \nThe 1930s Dust Bowl that threatened to turn the United States Great Plains into a \nvast desert was a traumatic experience that led to revolutionary changes in \nAmerican agricultural practices, such as the planting of tree shelterbelts—rows of \ntrees planted beside fields to slow wind and thus reduce wind erosion. Perhaps the \nmost lasting change is strip cropping, the planting of crops on alternate strips with \nfallowed (not planted) land each year. This permits soil moisture to accumulate on \nthe fallowed strips, while the planted strips reduce wind speed and hence the wind \nerosion on the idled strips. The key to controlling wind erosion is to keep the land \ncovered with vegetation as much as possible and to slow wind speed at ground \nlevel. \nOne of the time-tested methods of dealing with water erosion is terracing—creating \nhillside ridges—to reduce runoff. Another newer, highly effective tool in the soil \nconservation toolkit is conservation tillage, which includes both no-tillage and \nminimum tillage. In conventional farming, land is plowed, disked, or harrowed to \nprepare the seedbed, seed is drilled into the soil with a planter, and row crops are \ncultivated with a mechanical cultivator two or three times to control weeds. With \nminimum tillage, farmers simply drill seeds directly into the soil. The only tillage is a \none-time disturbance in a narrow band of soil where the seeds are inserted, leaving \nthe remainder of the soil undisturbed, covered by crop residues and thus resistant to \nboth water and wind erosion. \nIn the United States, where farmers during the 1990s were required to implement a \nsoil-conservation plan on erodible cropland to be eligible for crop price supports, the \nno-till area went from 7 million hectares in 1990 to nearly 21 million hectares (51 \nmillion acres) in 2000, tripling within a decade. An additional 23 million hectares were \nminimum-tilled, for a total of 44 million hectares of conservation tillage. This total \nincluded 37 percent of the corn crop, 57 percent of soybeans, and 30 percent of the \nwheat. Outside the United States, data for crop year 1998-1999 show Brazil using \nconservation tillage on 11 million hectares and Argentina on 7 million hectares. \nCanada, using conservation tillage on 4 million hectares, rounds out the \"big four.\" \nAnd now no-till farming is catching on in Europe, Africa, and Asia. In addition to \nreducing soil losses, minimum-till and no-till practices also help retain water and \nreduce energy use. \nAnother example of an effort to control soil erosion is the Conservation Reserve \nProgram (CRP). Created in the United States in 1985, the CRP aimed to convert 45 \nmillion acres of highly erodible land into permanent vegetative cover under ten-year \ncontracts. Under this program, farmers were paid to plant grass or trees on fragile \ncropland. The retirement of 35 million acres under the CRP, together with the \nadoption of conservation practices on 37 percent of all cropland, reduced soil erosion \nin the United States from 3.1 billion tons in 1982 to 1.9 billion tons in 1997. \nSaving cropland is sometimes more difficult than saving the topsoil on the cropland. \nThis is particularly the case when dealing with urban sprawl, where strong \ncommercial forces have influence. With cropland becoming scarce, efforts to protect \nprime farmland from urban spread are needed everywhere. Japan provides a good \nexample of such efforts. It has successfully protected rice paddies even within the \nboundaries of Tokyo, thus enabling it to remain self-sufficient in rice, its staple food. \nIn the United States, Portland, Oregon, provides another example. The state \nadopted boundaries to urban growth twenty years ago, requiring each community to \nproject its growth needs for the next two decades and then, based on the results, \ndraw an outer boundary that would accommodate that growth. This has worked in \nOregon because it has forced development back to the city.",

      "title": "Theories of Continental Drift",
      "content": "The idea that the past geography of Earth was different from today is not new. The \nearliest maps showing the east coast of South America and the west coast of Africa \nprobably provided people with the first evidence that continents may have once been \njoined together, then broken apart and moved to their present positions. \nDuring the late nineteenth century, Austrian geologist Eduard Suess noted the \nsimilarities between the Late Paleozoic plant fossils of India, Australia, South Africa, \nand South America. The plant fossils comprise a unique group of plants that occurs \nin coal layers just above the glacial deposits on these southern continents. In his \nbook The Face of the Earth (1885), he proposed the name \"Gondwanaland\" (called \nGondwana here) for a supercontinent composed of the aforementioned southern \nlandmasses. Suess thought these southern continents were connected by land \nbridges over which plants and animals migrated. Thus, in his view, the similarities of \nfossils on these continents were due to the appearance and disappearance of the \nconnecting land bridges. \nThe American geologist Frank Taylor published a pamphlet in 1910 presenting his \nown theory of continental drift. He explained the formation of mountain ranges as a \nresult of the lateral movements of continents. He also envisioned the present-day \ncontinents as parts of larger polar continents that eventually broke apart and \nmigrated toward the equator after Earth's rotation was supposedly slowed by gigantic \ntidal forces. According to Taylor, these tidal forces were generated when Earth's \ngravity captured the Moon about 100 million years ago. Although we know that \nTaylor's explanation of continental drift is incorrect, one of his most significant \ncontributions was his suggestion that the Mid-Atlantic Ridge—an underwater \nmountain chain discovered by the 1872-1876 British HMS Challenger \nexpeditions—might mark the site at which an ancient continent broke apart, forming \nthe present-day Atlantic Ocean. \nHowever, it is Alfred Wegener, a German meteorologist, who is generally credited \nwith developing the hypothesis of continental drift. In his monumental book, The \nOrigin of Continents and Oceans (1915), Wegener proposed that all landmasses \nwere originally united into a single supercontinent that he named \"Pangaea.\" \nWegener portrayed his grand concept of continental movement in a series of maps \nshowing the breakup of Pangaea and the movement of various continents to their \npresent-day locations. What evidence did Wegener use to support his hypothesis of \ncontinental drift? First, Wegener noted that the shorelines of continents fit together, \nforming a large supercontinent and that marine, nonmarine, and glacial rock \nsequences of Pennsylvanian to Jurassic ages are almost identical for all Gondwana \ncontinents, strongly indicating that they were joined together at one time. \nFurthermore, mountain ranges and glacial deposits seem to match up in such a way \nthat suggests continents could have once been a single landmass. And last, many of \nthe same extinct plant and animal groups are found today on widely separated \ncontinents, indicating that the continents must have been in proximity at one time. \nWegener argued that this vast amount of evidence from a variety of sources surely \nindicated the continents must have been close together at one time in the past. \nAlexander Du Toit, a South African geologist, was one of Wegener's ardent \nsupporters. He noted that fossils of the Permian freshwater reptile \"Mesosaurus\" \noccur in rocks of the same age in both Brazil and South Africa. Because the \nphysiology of freshwater and marine animals is completely different, it is hard to \nimagine how a freshwater reptile could have swum across the Atlantic Ocean and \nthen found a freshwater environment nearly identical to its former habitat. \nFurthermore, if Mesosaurus could have swum across the ocean, its fossil remains \nshould occur in other localities besides Brazil and South Africa. It is more logical to \nassume that Mesosaurus lived in lakes in what are now adjacent areas of South \nAmerica and Africa but were then united in a single continent. \nDespite what seemed to be overwhelming evidence presented by Wegener and later \nDu Toit and others, most geologists at the time refused to entertain the idea that the \ncontinents might have moved in the past.",

      "title": "Soil Formation",
      "content": "Soil formation is a dynamic process that takes place in different environments. It is \nstrongly influenced by the parent material, climate (largely vegetation and \ntemperature and water exchanges), topography (the elevations, depressions, \ndirections and angles of slopes, and other surface features of the landscape), and \ntime. \nThe parent material is the unconsolidated mass on which soil formation takes place. \nThis material may or may not be derived from the on-site geological substrate or \nbedrock on which it rests. Parent materials can be transported by wind, water, \nglaciers, and gravity and deposited on top of bedrock. Because of the diversity of \nmaterials involved, soils derived from transported parent materials are commonly \nmore fertile than soils from parent materials derived in place. Whatever the parent \nmaterial, whether derived in place from bedrock or from transported material, it \nultimately comes from geological materials, such as igneous, sedimentary, and \nmetamorphic rocks, and the composition of the rocks largely determines the \nchemical composition of the soil. \nClimate is most influential in determining the nature and intensity of weathering and \nthe type of vegetation that further affects soil formation. The soil material \nexperiences daily and seasonal variations in heating and cooling. Open surfaces \nexposed to thermal radiation undergo the greatest daily fluctuations in heating and \ncooling, soils covered with vegetation the least. Hill slopes facing the sun absorb \nmore heat than those facing away from the sun. Radiant energy has a pronounced \neffect on the moisture regime, especially the evaporative process and dryness. \nTemperature can stimulate or inhibit biogeochemical reactions in soil material. \nWater is involved in all biogeochemical reactions in the soil because it is the carrier \nof the acids that influence the weathering process. Water enters the soil material as \na liquid and leaves it as a liquid by percolation (the slow movement of water through \nthe soil's pores) and as a gas through evaporation. The water regime—the water \nflow over a given time—in soil material is sporadic, and in many parts of the Earth is \nhighly seasonal. Water that enters the soil during heavy rainfall and snowmelt moves \ndown through the soil. As it moves, it leaves behind suspended material and may \ncarry away mineral matter in solution, a process called leaching. On sloping land, \nwater distributes material laterally (sideways) through the soil. \nTopography is a major factor in soil development. More water runs off and less \nenters the soil on steep slopes than on relatively level land. Water draining from \nslopes enters the soil on low and flat land. Thus soils and soil material tend to be dry \non slopes and moist on the low land. Steep slopes are subject to surface erosion and \nsoil creep—the downslope movement of soil material, which accumulates on lower \nslopes and lowlands. \nVegetation, animals, bacteria, and fungi all contribute to the formation of soil. \nVegetation, in particular, is responsible for organic material in the soil and influences \nits nutrient content. For example, forests store most of their organic matter on the \nsurface, whereas in grasslands most of the organic matter added to the soil comes \nfrom the deep fibrous root systems. Organic acids produced by vegetation \naccelerate the weathering process. \nThe weathering of rock material and the accumulation, decomposition, and \nmineralization of organic material require considerable time. Well-developed soils in \nequilibrium with weathering, erosion, and biotic influences may require 2,000 to \n20,000 years for their formation, but soil differentiation from parent material may take \nplace in as short a time as 30 years. Certain acid soils in humid regions develop in \n2,000 years because the leaching process is speeded by acidic materials. Parent \nmaterials heavy in texture require a much longer time to develop into soils because \nof an impeded downward flow of water. Soils develop more slowly in dry regions than \nin humid ones. Soils on steep slopes often remain poorly developed regardless of \ngeological age because rapid erosion removes soil nearly as fast as it is formed. \nFloodplain soils age little through time because of the continuous accumulation of \nnew materials. Such soils are not deeply weathered and are more fertile than \ngeologically old soils because they have not been exposed to the leaching process \nas long. The latter soils tend to be infertile because of long-time leaching of nutrients \nwithout replacement from fresh material.",

      "title": "Earthquake Prediction",
      "content": "Research leading to short-term forecasting, which involves a shorter time interval, \nhas been focused on precursors observed prior to previous earthquakes. Precursors \nare physical or chemical phenomena that occur in a typical pattern before an \nearthquake. These phenomena include changes in the velocity of seismic waves, the \nelectrical resistance of rocks, the frequency of the usually minor preliminary \nearthquakes (foreshocks), the deformation of the land surface, and the water level or \nwater chemistry of wells in the area. Many of these precursors can be explained by a \ntheory called the dilatancy model. Under this hypothesis, rocks in the process of \nstrain along a fault show significant dilation or swelling before rupture. This volume \nincrease is caused by the opening of microcracks, which are minute failure zones in \nweaker mineral grains in the rock and along grain boundaries. Groundwater flows \ninto the highly stressed areas during the formation of microcracks. These changes in \ndensity and water content affect the ability of the rock to transmit seismic waves and \nconduct electricity. Therefore, seismic-wave velocity and electrical resistance \nprogressively change as the overall rupture along the fault draws near. Localized \nchanges in land-surface elevation are also related to volume changes at depth. An \narea of recent uplift along the San Andreas Fault near Los Angeles, which has been \nnamed the Palmdale Bulge, is being monitored in great detail as a possible indicator \nof a future earthquake. \nVolume changes and groundwater movement may be reflected by changes in water \nlevels in wells and also by changes in the chemical composition of groundwater. \nRadon gas has been observed to increase in wells prior to earthquakes. These \nincreases are perhaps related to the release of radon gas from rocks during the \nformation of microcracks. The pattern of seismic activity is also significant in the \nvicinity of a fault area where rupture is imminent. This pattern consists of an initial \nrise in the number of small events, followed by a decline in foreshocks just prior to \nthe major earthquake. The decline may represent a temporary increase in rock \nstrength before the newly formed microcracks are filled with water. \nThe precursor phenomena can be grouped into stages according to the dilatancy \nmodel. Stage I consists of a gradual stress buildup along the fault. Stages II and III \nare correlated with dilatancy and water influx. Stage IV is the major earthquake, and \nstage V is the aftermath of the event. If every earthquake followed the sequence with \nuniform stage duration, earthquake prediction would be a simple matter. Instead of \nfollowing the same patterns, each earthquake is unique in terms of specific precursor \nbehavior patterns and length of precursor stages. A magnitude 6.9 North American \nearthquake in 1989 was preceded by a substantially smaller magnitude 5 earthquake \nfifteen months before the event. Another foreshock of similar size occurred two \nmonths before the event. In each case, a public advisory was issued stating that \nthose smaller earthquakes could be foreshocks to a stronger earthquake within five \ndays. However, the fault did not cooperate, and those predictions were not \nsuccessful. Continued research and study of future earthquakes will certainly lead to \nrefinement of the dilatancy model or to a replacement model with more accurate \npredictive capabilities. \nTwo types of earthquake prediction are theoretically possible. The first type is \nlong-term forecasting, in which the probability of an earthquake along a particular \nsegment of a fault within a certain time interval is calculated by studying seismic \ngaps and historical records of earthquakes that have occurred along that fault \nsegment. By plotting the number of earthquakes within specific time intervals against \ntheir magnitudes, diagrams can be constructed for a local area. From this plot it is \npossible to estimate the recurrence interval, or the average time between \nearthquakes of a particular magnitude. For example, if a 6.0 magnitude earthquake \noccurs every 50 to 100 years along a particular fault segment, a 6.0 magnitude \nearthquake could occur at any time within that time span.",

      "title": "Cave and Rock Art",
      "content": "Some of the earliest human art to survive consists of engraved or painted works on \nopen-air rocks or on the floors, walls, and ceilings of caves, some of them in deep \ncrannies. They were created during the Upper Paleolithic period (40,000 to 10,000 \nB.C.), and the best were done by what we call the Magdalenians (from the name of a \nsite), peoples who flourished in Europe from 18,000 to 10,000 B.C. Such works have \na unity and can be described as the Magdalenian art system, the first in human \nhistory. It was also the longest, lasting for much of the total time humans have \nproduced art. \nIn any history of art, then, the Magdalenian system must occupy a place of \nimportance. Also, of all the forms of art practiced, it is the most different from any art \nproduced today, so much so that we have difficulty appreciating it. The art is difficult \nto understand partly because the system was so long-lasting. During its 8,000 years, \nartists would have been producing works for about 4,000 generations, each learning \nfrom the last and gradually introducing changes. However, these changes were so \nsubtle that to us, the earliest works are almost indistinguishable from the latest. In \nother words, the Magdalenian art system was one of the most stable cultural \nsystems in human history. Its stability implies that the artists were following a strict \nset of conventions that survived almost unchanged for millennia. \nMagdalenian art is almost entirely about animals. The animals depicted are mainly \nhorses, bison, ibex, mammoths, rhinoceroses, lions, and bears, with a few birds and \nfish. Human figures are very rare and are often crudely drawn or even disguised. \nThe animals are often shown with great naturalism and skill, but they are not \narranged in any kind of natural setting. They are simply placed on the rock surface, \noften overlapping each other, with no indication of ground line or landscape. This has \nled some scholars to suggest that the art was not meant to depict the real world but \nrather a spiritual or mythical one. \nThe meaning of the art is still a mystery. Some have suggested that it was part of \nhunting magic, designed to ensure success in the hunt. Others have argued that it \nwas related to shamanistic rituals, in which the animals were spirit helpers. Still \nothers have proposed that the caves were sanctuaries where initiation ceremonies \ntook place. Whatever its meaning, the art was clearly of great importance to the \nMagdalenians, as they went to great trouble to create it in the deepest, most \ninaccessible parts of caves, often carrying lamps and torches to light their way. \nThe caves themselves are often difficult to access, and some of the best paintings \nare in the most remote chambers. At Lascaux, for example, the famous Hall of the \nBulls is near the entrance, but other paintings are deep in the cave system. At \nAltamira, the famous ceiling paintings are in a side chamber, and visitors must \ncrouch to see them. This inaccessibility suggests that the art was not meant for \npublic viewing but rather for a select few, perhaps shamans or initiates. It also \nexplains why the art has survived so well; the caves provided a stable environment \nwith constant temperature and humidity, protecting the paintings from the elements. \nToday, many of the caves are closed to the public to protect the fragile paintings from \ndamage caused by visitors' breath, body heat, and the introduction of light. Even \nphotography is strictly controlled, and reproductions of the paintings often give a \npoor idea of their nature and quality. Some are difficult to see anyway: the best part \nof Altamira has to be studied lying down. Hence inaccessibility is a real and growing \nobstacle to unlocking the secrets of the Magdalenian art system.",

      "title": "Historical Trends in European Urban Planning",
      "content": "European city planning and design have a long history. Most Greek and Roman \nsettlements were deliberately laid out on the grid system, within which the siting of \nkey buildings was carefully thought out. The roots of modern Western urban planning \nand design can be traced to the Renaissance and Baroque periods (between the \nfifteenth and seventeenth centuries) in Europe, when artists and intellectuals \ndreamed of ideal cities, and rich and powerful regimes used urban design to produce \nextravagant symbolizations of wealth, power, and destiny. Inspired by the classical \nart forms of ancient Greece and Rome, Renaissance urban design sought to recast \ncities in a deliberate attempt to show off the power and the glory of the state and \nchurch. \nSpreading slowly from its origins in Italy at the beginning of the fifteenth century, \nRenaissance design successfully diffused to most of the larger cities of Europe. \nDramatic advances in weaponry brought a surge of planned redevelopment that \nfeatured impressive geometric-shaped fortifications and an extensive sloping, clear \nzone of fire. Inside new walls, cities were recast according to a new aesthetic of \ngrand design: fancy palaces, geometrical plans, streetscapes, and gardens that \nemphasized views of dramatic perspectives. These developments were often so \nextensive and so interconnected with each other that they effectively fixed the layout \nof cities well into the eighteenth, and even into the nineteenth, century, when walls \nand/or open spaces eventually made way for urban redevelopment in the form of \nparks, railway lines, or beltways. \nAs societies and economies became more complex with the transition to industrial \ncapitalism, national rulers and city leaders looked to urban design to impose order, \nsafety, and efficiency, as well as to symbolize the new seats of power and authority. \nThe most important early precedent was set in Paris by Napoleon III, who presided \nover a comprehensive program of urban redevelopment and monumental urban \ndesign. The work was carried out by Baron Georges-Eugene Haussmann between \n1853 and 1870. Haussmann demolished large sections of old Paris to make way for \nbroad, new, tree-lined avenues, with numerous public open spaces and monuments. \nIn doing so, he made the city not only more efficient (wide boulevards meant better \nflows of traffic) and a better place to live (parks and gardens allowed more fresh air \nand sunlight in a crowded city and were held to be a civilizing influence) but also \nsafer from revolutionary politics (wide boulevards were hard to barricade; \nmonuments and statues helped to instill a sense of pride and identity). \nThe preferred architectural style for these new designs was the Beaux Arts style. In \nthis school, architects were trained to draw on Classical, Renaissance, and Baroque \nstyles, synthesizing them in designs for new buildings for the Industrial Age. The \nidea was that the new buildings would blend artfully with the older palaces, \ncathedrals, and civic buildings that dominated European city centers. Haussmann's \nideas were widely influential and extensively copied. \nEarly in the twentieth century there emerged a different intellectual and artistic \nreaction to the pressures of industrialization and urbanization. This was the Modern \nmovement, which was based on the idea that buildings and cities should be \ndesigned and run like machines. Equally important to the Modernists was that urban \ndesign should not simply reflect dominant social and cultural values but, rather, help \nto create a new moral and social order. The movement's best-known advocate was \nLe Corbusier, a Paris-based Swiss who provided the inspiration for technocratic \nurban design. Modernist buildings sought to dramatize technology, exploit industrial \nproduction techniques, and use modern materials and unembellished, functional \ndesign. Le Corbusier's ideal city featured linear clusters of high-density, medium-rise \napartment blocks, elevated on stilts and segregated from industrial districts; high-rise \ntower office blocks; and transportation routes all separated by broad expanses of \npublic open space.",

      "title": "Mexican Muralism",
      "content": "The first major modern art movement in Latin America was Mexican muralism, which \nfeatured large-scale murals painted on the wall surfaces of public buildings. One of \nthe most persistent strands in Latin American art in the last 80 years has been an \nengagement with political and social issues, including the struggle for social justice. \nThis in turn has been accompanied by a desire for authentic forms of self-expression \nand freedom from cultural dependency. Although these preoccupations have taken \nmany different forms, Mexican muralism was the first, and its influence was the most \nfar-reaching. Muralism flourished in Mexico in the years immediately following the \nMexican Revolution (1910-1920) as a result of a combination of circumstances: a \nclimate of revolutionary optimism and cultural experimentation that challenged \ntraditional Eurocentrism; a small but strong group of relatively mature artists of \nenergy, ideas, and ability; and a visionary minister of education, Jose Vasconcelos. \nVasconcelos believed that Mexico was destined to play a central role on the \ninternational stage. He understood that ideas could be more quickly assimilated \nthrough images than through any other medium, and he had the courage to allocate \nthe funds, and the walls of public buildings, to the artists to do with as they liked. \nThe muralists shared a belief in the power of art to transform society for the better; to \nchallenge social, political, economic, and cultural stereotypes; and to enrich the \nintellectual life of their country. During the 1920s and 1930s, they covered miles of \nwall with paintings representing aspects of Mexico's past and present and the future \nto which all aspired. Although Mexican muralism is representational and often \nnarrative in form, it should be recognized as a modern movement. It was \nmodernizing in intent, in that it challenged the old order culturally, socially, and \npolitically. By definition, it was a public, accessible form of art, not a commodity that \ncould be bought and sold by the wealthy elite. Its purpose was to educate, inform, \nenlighten, politicize, and thus empower the general public, in particular the working \nclasses. \nThe muralist movement was not a unified force, however. The painters who were its \nleaders took different directions and did not always see eye to eye. Diego Rivera \n(1886-1957) sought to promote a pluralistic vision of Mexican society by drawing on \nthe rich heritage of the pre-Columbian past (before Christopher Columbus arrived in \nthe Americas in 1492) and contemporary popular culture, and he investigated \npre-Columbian styles and techniques in an effort to create an aesthetic language \nthat was new and Mexican. He was deeply influenced by native pictographic \ntraditions of communication in which pictures represent written words and ideas, and \nhe sought to develop a modern equivalent, a visual language that could be read like \na book. The art of Jose Clemente Orozco (1883-1949) is less optimistic: he saw both \nthe pre-Columbian past and the revolutionary present in a more negative light, the \nformer as barbarous, the latter often tarnished by corruption and cruelty. He offers no \ncomforting narratives, and his expressive, aggressive technique serves as a \nmetaphor of Mexico's harsh, contradictory reality. David Alfaro Siqueiros (1898-1976) \nwas the most politically active of the three and was an internationalist both \nideologically and artistically. In his art he deliberately avoided traditional materials \nand methods, preferring to use modern industrial paints and spray guns. His works \nlook forward to a fully socialist future where the workers will have won the right to the \nbenefits of the modern industrial era, and his often fragmented, complex imagery \ndoes not patronize or make concessions to his audience. \nThe Mexican muralist movement is undoubtedly one of the most important \nmanifestations of twentieth-century Mexican culture. Its impact elsewhere in the \nregion, as well as in the United States and Europe, has been enormous. The work of \nRivera, Orozco, and Siqueiros triggered a homegrown muralist movement in the \nUnited States in cities like New York City, Detroit, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. \nThe influence of the Mexicans on the modern Spanish painter Picasso's first mural \nand almost his only major explicitly propagandist work of art—his famous Guernica \nof 1937—is unmistakable even though the artist himself would have denied it. In \nLatin America, Mexican-influenced muralism has recurred whenever artists have felt \nthe need to make a clear, public statement in a language that has not been borrowed \nfrom outside.",

      "title": "The Olmecs",
      "content": "The earliest Mesoamerican art and architecture to combine ideological complexity, \ncraft, and permanence was that of the Olmecs, whose civilization flourished between \nabout 1500 B.C. and 100 B.C. The early Olmecs established major ceremonial \ncenters along the rich lowlands of the modern Mexican states of Veracruz and \nTabasco. At distant Teopanteucantilan, the Olmecs established a sacred precinct, \nthe first monumental evidence of the Olmecs in the highlands. But the Olmecs had \nan advanced social and economic system, with networks for commerce extending far \nto the west and south. The fertile gulf plain probably allowed for an agricultural \nsurplus, controlled by only a handful of individuals. From the art and architecture of \ntheir ceremonial centers (we know too little about Olmec domestic life to call their \nsites cities), it is clear that for the Olmecs, social stratification was sufficiently \nadvanced for their society to place great importance on the records of specific \nindividuals, particularly in the form of colossal heads (enormous stone sculptures of \nhuman heads and faces). \nLong before modern radiocarbon dating testified to the antiquity of this culture, \narchaeologists and art historians had become aware of the power of Olmec art \nthrough individual objects. Some even identified the Olmec culture as the oldest of \nMesoamerican civilizations, perhaps a mother culture from which all others derived, \nas the art historian Miguel Covarrubias once thought. Eventually the antiquity of \nOlmec culture was confirmed, and today many important elements of Mesoamerican \nart and architecture can be seen to have had a probable Olmec origin: ball courts, \npyramids, portraiture, and mirrors. Some later Mesoamerican deities probably derive \nfrom Olmec gods, and even the famous \"Maya\" calendar was already in use by \npeoples in the Olmec area at the dawn of Maya civilization. \nOne of the first important Olmec objects to come to modern attention was the Kunz \naxe, acquired in the 1860s in Oaxaca, Mexico. The ceremonial axe puzzled and \nintrigued investigators for years because on the one hand, it was clearly neither \nAztec nor Maya, the best-known ancient Mesoamerican cultures, and in fact it had \nno features that could be linked with any known civilization, while on the other hand, \nit had surely been made in Mesoamerica in antiquity. \nThe axe exhibits many qualities of the style we now call Olmec: precious blue-green \ntranslucent jade, worked to reveal a figure in both two and three dimensions. More \nthan half the axe is devoted to the creature's face: an open, toothless mouth, and \nclosely set, slanting eyes which has often been likened to the face of a howling \nhuman infant. The creature's hands are worked in lower relief, and in them he grasps \na miniature version of himself. Feet and toes are indicated only by incision (carved \nlines), and incision also marks the face, ears, and upper body, perhaps to suggest \ntattooing, ear ornaments, and a tunic. For over two millennia this large, precious axe \nwas presumably kept as a treasure or heirloom. It was not until 1955, after several \nseasons of excavation at La Venta had produced many fine jade objects and a \nconvincing series of radiocarbon dates in the first millennium B.C., that objects such \nas the Kunz axe were at last understood by scholars to embody the principles of the \nfirst great art style of Mesoamerica. \nEarly scholars of the Olmec style noticed a pattern of imagery repeated on many of \nthe carved stone objects. Many howling baby faces were found, and other faces \nseemed to combine the features of humans and jaguars (large cats). Today, while \nthe presence of jaguar imagery is still acknowledged, scholars have discovered that \naspects of many other tropical rainforest fauna can be identified in the carvings. The \ncaiman (a kind of alligator), eagle, toad, jaguar, and snake all appear in the Olmec \nrepertoire, singly and in combination. Moreover, scenes depicted on stone carvings \nand on pottery probably represent events in Olmec mythology, which served as a \ncomplex symbolic code that remained in use for a thousand years.",

      "title": "Portraiture",
      "content": "According to the Oxford English Dictionary, portraiture is, \"a representation or \ndelineation of a person, especially of the face, made by life, by drawing, painting, \nphotographing, engraving... a likeness.\" However, this simplistic definition disregards \nthe complexities of portraiture. Portraits are works of art that engage with ideas of \nidentity as they are perceived, represented, and understood in different times and \nplaces, rather than simply aim to represent a likeness. These concepts of identity \ncan encompass social hierarchy, gender, age, profession, and the character of the \nsubject, among other things. Rather than being fixed, these features are expressive \nof the expectations and circumstances of the time when the portrait was made. It is \nimpossible to reproduce the aspects of identity; it is only possible to evoke or \nsuggest them. Consequently, even though portraits represent individuals, it is \ngenerally conventional or typical—rather than unique—qualities of subject that are \nstressed by the artist. Portrait art has also undergone significant shifts in artistic \nconvention and practice. Despite the fact that the majority of portraits portray the \nsubject matter in some amount of verisimilitude (an appearance of being true or \nreal), they are still the outcome of prevailing artistic fashions and favored styles, \ntechniques, and media. Therefore, portrait art is a vast art category which provides a \nwide range of engagements with social, psychological, and artistic practices and \nexpectations. \nSince portraits are distinct from other genres or art categories in the ways they are \nproduced, the nature of what they represent, and how they function as objects of use \nand display, they are worthy of separate study. First, during their production, portraits \nrequire the presence of a specific person, or an image of the individual to be \nrepresented, in almost all cases. In the majority of instances, the production of \nportraiture has necessitated sittings, which result in interaction between the \nsubject(s) and artist throughout the creation of the work. If the sitter is of high social \nstanding or is occupied and unavailable to sit in the studio regularly, portraitists could \nuse photographs or sketches of their subject. In Europe, during the seventeenth and \neighteenth century, the sitting time was sometimes decreased by focusing solely on \nthe head and using professional drapery painters to finish the painting. For instance, \nSir Peter Lely, the English artist, had a collection of poses in a pattern book that \nenabled him to focus on the head and require fewer sittings from his aristocratic \npatrons. Portrait painters could be asked to present the likeness of individuals who \nwere deceased. In this sort of instance, photographs or prints of the subject could be \nreproduced. Theoretically, portraitists could work from impressions or memories \nwhen creating a painting, but this is a rare occurrence according to documented \nrecords. Nonetheless, whether the work is based on model sittings, copying a \nphotograph or sketch, or using memory, the process of painting a portrait is closely \nlinked with the implicit or explicit attendance of the model. \nFurthermore, portrait painting can be differentiated from other artistic genres like \nlandscape, still life, and history by its connection with appearance, or likeness. As \nsuch, the art of portrait painting got a reputation for imitation, or copying, instead of \nfor artistic innovation or creativity; consequently, it is sometimes viewed as being of a \nlower status than the other genres. According to Renaissance art theory (which \nprevailed until the start of the nineteenth century), fine art was supposed to represent \nidealized images, as well as to be original and creative instead of to copy other \nworks. Portraiture, in comparison, became linked with the level of a mechanical \nexercise as opposed to a fine art. Michelangelo's well-known protest that he would \nnot paint portraits because there were not enough ideally beautiful models is only \none example of the dismissive attitude to portraiture that persisted among \nprofessional artists—even those who, ironically, made their living from portraiture. In \nthe time of modernism, during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the attitude \ntowards portraiture was critical. Even so, artists from around the globe persisted in \npainting portraits in spite of their theoretical objections. Picasso, for instance, \nbecame renowned for cubist still-life painting early in his career, but some of his most \neffective early experiments in this new style were his portraits of art dealers.",

      "title": "The Origins of Motion Pictures",
      "content": "The principle that makes possible the motion picture we watch today has been \nknown for centuries. It is called the persistence of vision: the tendency of the eye to \nbriefly retain an image after it has disappeared. As early as the second century, the \nGreek astronomer and mathematician Ptolemy had observed that a disk with a \npicture on one side, when twirled rapidly, appears as a single blended image. This \nprinciple was demonstrated in the nineteenth century by a number of European toys. \nIn 1824, Peter Roget demonstrated that the eye retains an image for about one-tenth \nof a second. This led to the invention of the Thaumatrope, a disk with a bird on one \nside and a cage on the other. When the disk was twirled, the bird appeared to be in \nthe cage. The Phenakistoscope, invented in 1832, used a spinning disk with \nsequential drawings viewed through slits to create the illusion of movement. The \nZoetrope, invented in 1834, and the Praxinoscope, invented in 1877, improved on \nthis principle. \nBefore long, several people realized that a series of still photographs on celluloid film \ncould be used instead of hand drawings. In 1878, a colorful Englishman, later turned \nAmerican, Eadweard Muybridge, attempted to settle a $25,000 bet over whether the \nfour feet of a galloping horse ever simultaneously left the ground. He arranged a \nseries of 24 cameras alongside a racetrack to photograph a galloping horse. Rapidly \nviewing the series of pictures produced an effect much like that of a motion picture. \nMuybridge's technique not only settled the bet (the feet did leave the ground \nsimultaneously at certain instances) but also advanced photography. Instead of 24 \ncameras taking one picture in rapid order, it was Thomas Edison and his assistant, \nWilliam Dickson, who finally developed what might have been the first practical \nmotion-picture camera and viewing device. Edison was apparently trying to provide a \nvisual counterpart to his recently invented phonograph. When his early efforts did not \nwork out, he turned the project over to his assistant. Using flexible film, Dickson \nsolved the vexing problem of how to move the film rapidly through the camera by \nperforating its edge with tiny holes and pulling it along by means of sprockets, \nprojections on a wheel that fit into the holes of the film. In 1889, Dickson had \nperfected a machine called the Kinetoscope and even starred in a brief film \ndemonstrating how it worked. \nThe Kinetoscope was a viewing device for individual use. A viewer looked through a \npeephole at the top of the cabinet to watch a short film that ran in a continuous loop. \nIn 1893, Edison opened the first Kinetoscope parlor in New York City, where \ncustomers could view films for a penny. The Kinetoscope was a success, but it had \nlimitations. Only one person could view the film at a time, and the films were very \nshort. In Europe, inventors were working on projecting films onto a screen for large \naudiences. The Lumière brothers in France invented the Cinématographe, a \ncombination camera and projector, in 1895. Their first public screening in Paris is \noften considered the birth of cinema as we know it. In the United States, Thomas \nArmat invented the Vitascope, a projector that Edison later manufactured and \nmarketed. The first public screening of a motion picture in the United States using \nthe Vitascope took place in New York City in 1896. \nEarly movies were simple snippets of action—acrobats tumbling, horses running, \njugglers juggling, and so on. Eventually, the novelty wore off and films became less \nof an attraction. Public interest was soon rekindled when early filmmakers \ndiscovered that movies could be used to tell a story. In France, Alice Guy-Blaché \nproduced The Cabbage Fairy, a one-minute film about a fairy who produces children \nin a cabbage patch, and exhibited it at the Paris International Exhibition in 1896. \nGuy-Blaché went on to found her own studio in America. Better known is the work of \na fellow French filmmaker and magician, Georges Méliès. In 1902, Méliès produced \na science-fiction film that was the great-great-grandfather of Star Wars and Star \nTrek; it was called A Trip to the Moon.",

      "title": "Bioluminescence in Marine Creatures",
      "content": "At night along the sea's edge, the ocean sometimes seems to glow, as if from within. \nThis glow is the result of bioluminescence, a phenomenon exhibited by many of the \nsea's zooplankton. Bioluminescence is the production of cold light through internal \nbiological processes, as opposed to phosphorescence or fluorescence, both of which \nare re-emitted light that was initially absorbed from an external source. \nMany of the sea's creatures, including squid, dinoflagellates, bacteria, worms, \ncrustaceans, and fish, are known to produce light. The process that marine creatures \nuse to create light is like that of the common firefly and similar to that which creates \nthe luminous green color seen in plastic glow sticks, often used as children's toys or \nfor illumination during nighttime events. When a glow stick is bent, two chemicals \nmix, react, and create a third substance that gives off light. Bioluminescent \norganisms do essentially the same thing; they have a substance, called luciferin, that \nreacts with oxygen in the presence of an enzyme, luciferase. When the reaction is \ncomplete, a new molecule is formed that gives off light—glowing blue-green in color. \nMost bioluminescent creatures produce this blue-green light because it travels best \nin water. Some organisms, however, can produce red or yellow light, and a few can \neven produce multiple colors. \nIn many bioluminescent creatures, the light is produced in special organs called \nphotophores. These organs can be simple or complex. In some fish, the photophores \nare equipped with lenses, shutters, color filters, and reflectors, much like a \nhuman-made lamp. The organism can control the light, turning it on and off, and \neven changing its intensity and color. Some creatures, like the flashlight fish, have a \norgan below each eye that contains bioluminescent bacteria. The fish can blink to \ncover the light, creating a flashing effect. Others, like some species of squid, can \neject a cloud of bioluminescent fluid to confuse predators, much like an ink cloud. \nHow and why bioluminescence occurs is not fully understood; however, in the \nundersea realm, it appears to be used in a variety of interesting and ingenious ways. \nThe most commonly observed form of bioluminescence in the sea is the pinpoint \nsparking of light at night that can create comet-like trails behind moving objects. \nAlmost always, this is the result of dinoflagellates reacting to water motion. The \nrelatively short, momentary displays of light may have evolved to startle, distract, or \nfrighten would-be predators. Collection nets brought up from the sea's depths at \nnight frequently glow green at great distance. Slowly fading green blobs or pulses of \nlight can be seen coming from the organisms within, often from gelatinous creatures. \nThis type of light display may be used to stun, disorient, or lure prey. Like a \nwide-eyed deer caught on a road and dazed by headlights, undersea creatures living \nwithin the ocean's darkness may be momentarily disoriented by short flashes of \nbioluminescent light. Another of the sea's light-producing organisms is a small \ncopepod (a type of crustacean) named Sapphirina iris. In the water, Sapphirina \ncreates short flashes of a remarkably rich, azure blue light. But its appearance under \na microscope is even more spectacular: the living copepod appears as if constructed \nof delicately handcrafted, multicolored pieces of stained glass. Within the deep sea, \nsome fish also have a dangling bioluminescent lure or a patch of luminescent skin \nnear the mouth, which may be used to entice unsuspecting prey. \nBioluminescence may also serve a variety of other functions. Some species use it to \ncommunicate with potential mates. In the deep sea, where darkness is complete, the \nability to produce light can be an effective way to signal one's presence, species, and \nreadiness to mate. Some species use bioluminescence as a form of camouflage. By \nproducing light that matches the downwelling light from the surface, an organism can \neffectively eliminate its silhouette, making it nearly invisible to predators below. This \nstrategy, known as counter-illumination, is used by many fish, shrimp, and squid. Still \nother species use bioluminescence to attract prey. The anglerfish, for example, has a \nbioluminescent lure that dangles in front of its mouth, attracting smaller fish that it \nthen snaps up.",

      "title": "Coral Reef Communities",
      "content": "Coral reefs are massive underwater structures made from the hard limestone \nexoskeletons of thousands of tiny living organisms (coral polyps) produced one on \ntop of another in warm, clear, shallow ocean waters. Living polyps extend upward \nand outward from the coral colony center and live on top of the old dead \nexoskeletons. Coral reef communities are crowded with other animals representing \nvirtually every major animal phylum. Space is at a premium on reefs; corals, \nseaweeds (various forms of algae), sponges, or other organisms cover virtually \nevery surface. Because both corals and algae require light to survive, access to light, \nlike space, is also a resource subject to competition. \nFast-growing, branching corals can grow over slower-growing, encrusting, or \nmassive corals and deny them light. In response, the slower-growing forms can \nextend stinging filaments from their digestive cavity and kill their competitor's polyps. \nUndamaged polyps on the faster-growing, branching coral, however, may grow very \nlong sweeper tentacles, containing powerful nematocysts (stingers) that kill polyps \non the slower-growing form. The faster-growing form repairs the damage and \ncontinues to overgrow its competitor. In addition to sweeper tentacles and stinging \nfilaments, corals have several other mechanisms available for attack or defense. \nIn general, slower-growing corals are more aggressive than fast-growing species. In \ncases where a competitor cannot be overcome, however, corals may survive by \ntaking advantage of differences in local habitats. Massive corals are generally more \nshade tolerant and able to survive at greater depths. Therefore, on many reefs it is \nthe fast-growing, branching corals that ultimately dominate at the upper, shallower \nportion of the reef, whereas more massive forms dominate in deeper areas. \nCorals also must compete with other reef organisms, each with its own strategies for \nsurvival. Sponges, soft corals, and seaweeds (algae) can overgrow stony corals and \nsmother them. Algae are competitively superior to corals in shallow water but less so \nat depth. Survival of coral in shallow water, therefore, may depend on grazing by \nplant-eating echinoderms (starfish and sea urchins) and fishes. In Jamaica, \noverfishing removed most of the plant-eating fish from coral reefs. Initially, algal \ngrowth was kept in check by grazing sea urchins, but in 1982, a pathogen reduced \nthe urchin population by 99 percent. Without grazers, the algae were able to \ncompletely overgrow the coral. \nCompetition may occur among other reef communities. Grazing by urchins and \nfishes is important in preventing seaweeds from overgrowing the reef. The dominant \nalgae on a healthy reef are usually fast-growing filamentous forms or coralline algae, \nwell protected by calcification (hardening) and the production of noxious chemicals. \nThese algae are inferior competitors to larger, fleshier seaweeds, so grazing by \nurchins and fishes on the larger seaweeds allows these algae to persist. Grazing on \nplants is greatest in the shallow reef areas but decreases with depth, where lower \ntemperatures and light reduce algal growth. The reef is, therefore, a mosaic of \nmicrohabitats with different levels of grazing and different algal communities. \nAn additional complexity arises from the activity of damselfish. Because they are \nterritorial, many damselfish species exclude grazers and other species from certain \nareas of the reef. Algae grow rapidly in these territories, providing habitat for many \nsmall invertebrates but overgrowing the corals. Branching corals tend to dominate in \ndamselfish territories because they are upright and faster growing than the more \nmassive or encrusting forms. \nAlthough less studied than on rocky shores, predation almost certainly has a \nsignificant influence on the community structure of coral reefs. Fish and other \npredators may preferentially prey on such competitors of corals as sponges and \ngorgonians, giving competitively inferior reef corals an advantage in securing space. \nMany species of fish, mollusks, and crustaceans also feed directly on coral polyps. \nSeveral surgeonfish and parrotfish may actually pass coral skeletons through their \ndigestive tracts and add sediment to the reef. Both fish and invertebrate corallivores \n(coral-feeding organisms) seem to attack faster-growing, branching species \npreferentially, perhaps preventing slower-growing forms from being overgrown. \nCorallivores, however, rarely ever completely destroy a coral colony except in cases \nwhere tropical storms or humans have already done severe damage. The fact that \nalmost all small invertebrates on reefs are so well hidden or highly camouflaged is \nanother indicator of how prevalent predation is on reefs and its importance in \ndetermining reef structure.",

      "title": "Sea Turtle Hatchling Strategies for Navigation",
      "content": "Sea turtles' eggs are laid at night to minimize the likelihood of their discovery by \npredators, and the offspring, when ready to emerge from their eggshells and dig their \nway out of the sand, hatch at night for the same reason. Since the offspring are \nespecially vulnerable immediately after hatching, it is vital for them to get to the sea \nas soon as possible. Turtle hatchlings use a number of cues to tell them where the \nsea is. \nThe most important cue seems to be light. The night sky is usually brightest over the \nsea. Cover a turtle hatchling's eyes, and it cannot find the sea even if there is other \ninformation available, such as a downward slope of the sand toward the water's \nedge. The hatchlings respond to light cues covering a vertical range of only about \n30° above the horizon or, depending on the species, even less. Responding only to \nlights that are close to the horizon decreases the risk that hatchlings will become \nconfused. They seem less attracted to yellow light than to other colors—loggerhead \nturtles show an aversion to yellow light—and this preference may keep them from \nbecoming disoriented by the rising Sun. \nIt is usually safest to have more than one internal compass, and hatchlings seem to \nbe guided by more than light alone. They steer away from sand dunes and \nvegetation. Possibly these objects merely block light behind them that might mislead \nturtle hatchlings about where the sea is, but it is also possible that turtles are \nsensitive to the shape of such objects and process these shapes as signals that the \nsea is located in some other direction. Such reinforcing cues, however, are not \nenough to guide hatchlings away from the artificial lights that now burn on many a \nbeach environment. Artificial lighting is often strong enough to completely overcome \nthe signals a hatchling sea turtle is programmed to recognize. Artificial light, if it is \nbright enough, becomes a stimulus so powerful that the hatchlings respond to \nnothing else, crawling toward it from hundreds of meters away. \nIf all goes well and the hatchlings scramble over the sand in the right direction, avoid \ntheir enemies, and reach the surf, a new set of orienting mechanisms takes over. As \nsoon as they are afloat, the hatchlings begin to swim at something over 1.5 \nkilometers per hour. They dive into the path of the wave undertow, where the \nreceding waters sweep them outward, away from the beach. When they surface \nagain, they head for open sea. This time, they are guided not by sight but apparently \nexclusively by the direction of the incoming waves. Experiments with loggerheads, \ngreens, and leatherbacks have shown that hatchlings swim toward approaching \nwaves; but if the sea is calm, they swim randomly or in circles. Under experimental \nconditions, hatchlings will swim into the waves even if doing so sends them back to \nthe beach again. \nThe farther a hatchling gets from shore, the less reliable wave direction becomes as \na pointer to the open sea. Researchers have shown that hatchling green sea turtles \nreleased from a hatchery in Borneo, East Malaysia, are able to navigate around \nsmall islands and keep swimming offshore, even when there are few waves to guide \nthem. They may be relying on yet another internal compass, this time oriented to \nEarth's magnetic field. Recent experiments suggest that leatherback and olive ridley \nhatchlings \"switch on\" their geomagnetic compass almost as soon as they are out of \nthe nest. Though the hatchlings position themselves geomagnetically as soon as \nthey leave the nest and appear to be able to use that position as a reference point, \nthey will not follow it automatically if other cues, such as light and sound, are \navailable. Hatchlings find their geomagnetic compass useful only after they have \nalready been able to determine the direction they should swim. A simple directional \ncompass—one that always sent the turtles westward, for instance—would be \nuseless if the open sea lay in some other direction. Therefore, a magnetic compass \ndoes not so much tell a hatchling turtle which way to go as keep it on course once it \nhas determined the direction it should swim from some other cue.",

      "title": "Temperature Regulation in Marine Organisms",
      "content": "There are two extremes of temperature regulation in organisms. Homeotherms are \norganisms that regulate body temperature to a constant level, usually above that of \nthe ambient (surrounding) environment. A constant and relatively high body \ntemperature enables biochemical reactions to occur in a relatively constant internal \nenvironment and at a relatively high rate. Most birds have a body temperature of \nabout 40°C, whereas the temperature of most marine mammals is about 38°C. \nBecause such temperatures are much higher than that of most seawater, marine \nhomeotherms lose heat rapidly to the surrounding environment. \nThere is another completely different style of living. Poikilotherms are organisms \nwhose body temperature conforms to that of the ambient environment. All subtidal \nmarine invertebrates and most fishes fit into this category. There is an interesting \nintermediate status in which body temperature is usually somewhat higher than \nambient temperature. Strong-swimming fishes, such as skipjack tuna and yellowfin \ntuna, have this intermediate status. Their rise in temperature above ambient \nconditions stems from metabolic heat generated by muscular activity (swimming) \ncombined with a heat retention mechanism. The temperature rise is probably \nnecessary to generate the increased biochemical reaction rates that are needed for \nsustained activity. In contrast, some intertidal animals are not true poikilotherms; they \nmaintain themselves at lower-than-ambient body temperature, using both \nevaporation and circulation of body fluids to avoid being heated at low tide by the \nSun. Their body temperatures, therefore, differ from that of an inanimate object of \nthe same size and shape that might be placed on the shore. Intertidal organisms \nabsorb and lose heat directly to the air. Darker-colored forms can absorb more heat \nthan can light-colored forms; therefore, variation in color can reflect differences in \nadaptation to the capture of solar energy at different latitudes. \nOcean temperatures are usually less than 27°C and may be less than 0°C in some \nlocations and during some seasons. Therefore, most homeothermic mammals and \nbirds must lose heat continuously to the environment. Their skin is the main pathway \nof heat loss, especially by direct conduction of heat from the skin to the contacting \ncolder water. Because animals have a circulatory system, heat loss from the body \nsurface also occurs as warm interior blood is transferred and moves into contact with \nthe periphery of the body. Their bodies also radiate heat, usually in the infrared part \nof the spectrum. Finally, as animals exhale, the resulting evaporation of water \ninvolves a considerable loss of heat. \nThe first line of defense against heat loss is a well-insulated body surface. Marine \nbirds deal with this problem by means of specially adapted feathers. A series of \ninterlocking contour feathers encloses a thick layer of down feathers that traps \nstationary air, which in turn acts as an insulating layer. Whales, porpoises, and seals \nare insulated against the lower sea temperatures by a thick layer of subcutaneous \nfat. Sea otters lack such a layer, but they constantly preen and fluff up a relatively \nthick layer of fur. Such mechanisms are only partly successful, however, and to \ngenerate more body heat to maintain a constant temperature, marine mammals \nusually must have a higher metabolic rate than similarly sized terrestrial (land) \nanimals. \nIn marine mammals that have limbs, the limbs are the principal sources of heat loss \nbecause they expose a relatively greater amount of body surface area per unit \nvolume to cold water. However, warm arterial blood must be supplied to limbs, such \nas the flipper of a porpoise. Heat loss in porpoises is minimized by a countercurrent \nheat exchanger. The arteries are surrounded by veins, within which blood is \nreturning to the core of the animal. At any contact point, the artery, which is on the \ninside, is warmer than a surrounding vein, so heat is lost to the returning venous \nblood flow. Heat is thus reabsorbed and returned to the porpoise's body core. This \nspatial relationship of circulatory vessels minimizes heat loss to the flipper and \nthence to the water. Although the anatomical details are quite different, fishes such \nas skipjack tuna have a circulatory anatomy based on the same overall design. \nArteries and veins in the near-surface musculature are in contact, and in arteries and \nveins, respectively, blood flows in opposite directions.",

      "title": "Dolphin Brains and Intelligence",
      "content": "Large brain size does not always mean that an animal is highly intelligent. Brain size \nis necessarily associated with overall body size, with large animals having large \nbrains and small animals having small brains. However, it is still necessary for there \nto be some minimum amount of circuitry (brain cells and processes) present for a \nspecies to have the potential to be highly intelligent, whatever way the term \nintelligence is defined. A measure of relative brain size that has been applied to a \nvariety of species is the encephalization quotient (EQ), the ratio of brain mass to \nbody size. The EQ is calculated by measuring the relative size of different body parts \nover a wide range of species. An EQ of 1.0 means that the brain is exactly the size \none would expect for an animal of a particular size; an EQ higher than 1.0 means \nthat a species is relatively brainy. \nBottlenose dolphins have a very high EQ, about 2.8 or higher. Thus, dolphin brains \nare not simply absolutely large; they are relatively very large as well. Humans, by the \nway, have extremely high EQ values, estimated to be in the neighborhood of 7.5, \nmaking our species the brainiest in existence. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that EQ \nlevels in several species of odontocetes (toothed whales, dolphins, and porpoises) \nare significantly higher than is the case for any primate except our own species. The \nEQ value for a species relates to a number of general measures of cognitive \nprocessing ability in different mammals, as well as to a number of life history patterns \nin mammals. EQ may be correlated with life span, home-range size, and social \nsystems that characterize a particular species. Oddly enough, the relationships \nfound between EQ and other factors in primates and some other mammals do not \nappear to apply as well to cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises), including the \nbottlenose dolphin. \nThe reasons for the larger-than-normal brain of the bottlenose dolphin (and indeed of \nsmall odontocetes in general) are not clearly understood. To navigate and detect \nprey, dolphins emit calls into the environment and then listen to the echoes of the \ncalls that return from nearby objects, a process known as echolocation. Among the \nmore plausible suggestions for large brain size are that the complexity of processing \nhigh-frequency echolocation information requires the development of large centers in \nthe cerebral hemispheres, and/or that the degree of sociality exhibited by many \nspecies, in which individual animals recognize and have particular long- and \nshort-term relationships with a number of other individuals, has favored the \nevolutionary development of a large, complex brain. Some authors develop a strong \ncase that extreme development of the auditory (hearing) system may be the primary \nreason for the dolphin's large brain. This opinion is supported by observations that \nthe auditory regions of the dolphin brain are 7 to 250 times larger than the equivalent \nregions of the human brain and by observations of very fast auditory brain stem \nresponses to sounds. It should be noted, however, that sperm whales are very social \nand good echolocators (that is, good at locating objects by emitting sounds and \ndetecting the reflections given back), yet their EQ values are low—only about 0.3. \nEven some small, less social odontocetes such as Indus river dolphins echolocate \nwell but do not possess the exceptionally large brains that bottlenose dolphins do. \nNoted biologist Peter Tyack has studied dolphin brains and argues persuasively that \nlarge brains evolved in dolphins to permit complex social functions. As is the case \nwith certain primates, bottlenose dolphins and certain other large-brained \nodontocetes have developed societies in which there exists a balance between \ncooperation and competition among particular individuals. The social politics of \nchimpanzees and dolphins show some remarkable similarities, especially in terms of \nthe importance of social relations extending far beyond the mother-offspring \nrelationship to include individuals of both sexes across the age range. The \ndevelopment of such complex societies may have favored the evolution of large \nbrain size. \nThe reason that dolphins have a large brain continues to be somewhat elusive, but \nthere must be a reason, since maintenance of brain tissue is metabolically \nexpensive. The adult human brain, for example, may only represent 2 percent of the \nbody weight, but it can account for nearly 20 percent of the metabolic rate (the \nenergy used).",

      "title": "Bird Colonies",
      "content": "About 13 percent of bird species, including most seabirds, nest in colonies. Colonial \nnesting evolves in response to a combination of two environmental conditions: (1) a \nshortage of nesting sites that are safe from predators and (2) abundant or \nunpredictable food that is distant from safe nest sites. Colonial nesting has both \nadvantages and disadvantages. First and foremost, individual birds are safer in \ncolonies that are inaccessible to predators, as on small rocky islands. In addition, \ncolonial birds detect predators more quickly than do small groups or pairs and can \ndrive the predators from the vicinity of the nesting area. Because nests at the edges \nof breeding colonies are more vulnerable to predators than those in the centers, the \npreference for advantageous central sites promotes dense centralized packing of \nnests. \nThe yellow-rumped cacique, which nests in colonies in Amazonian Peru, \ndemonstrates how colonial birds prevent predation. These tropical blackbirds defend \ntheir closed, pouchlike nests against predators in three ways. First, by nesting on \nislands and near wasp nests, caciques are safe from arboreal mammals such as \nprimates. Second, caciques mob predators (work together as a group to attack \npredators). The effectiveness of mobbing increases with group size, which increases \nwith colony size. Third, caciques hide their nests from predators by mixing active \nnests with abandoned nests. Overall, nests in clusters on islands and near wasp \nnests suffer the least predation. \nCoordinated social interactions tend to be weak when a colony is first forming, but \ntrue colonies provide extra benefits. Synchronized nesting, for example, produces an \nabundance of eggs and chicks that exceeds the daily needs of local predators. \nAdditionally, colonial neighbors can improve their foraging by watching others. This \nbehavior is especially valuable when the off-site food supplies are restricted or \nvariable in location, as are swarms of aerial insects harvested by swallows. The \ncolonies of American cliff swallows, for example, serve as information centers from \nwhich unsuccessful individual birds follow successful neighbors to good feeding \nsites. Cliff swallows that are unable to find food return to their colony, locate a \nneighbor that has been successful, and then follow that neighbor to its food source. \nAll birds in the colony are equally likely to follow or to be followed and thus contribute \nto the sharing of information that helps to ensure their reproductive success. As a \nresult of their enhanced foraging efficiency, parent swallows in large colonies return \nwith food for their nestlings more often and bring more food each trip than do parents \nin small colonies. \nTo support large congregations of birds, suitable colony sites must be near rich, \nclumped food supplies. Colonies of pinyon jays and red crossbills settle near \nseed-rich conifer forests, and wattled starlings nest in large colonies near locust \noutbreaks. The huge colonies of guanay cormorants and other seabirds that nest on \nthe coast of Peru depend on the productive cold waters of the Humboldt Current. \nThe combination of abundant food in the Humboldt Current and the vastness of \noceanic habitat can support enormous populations of seabirds, which concentrate at \nthe few available nesting locations. The populations crash when their food supplies \ndecline during El Niño years. \nAmong the costs, colonial nesting leads to increased competition for nest sites and \nmates, the stealing of nest materials, and increased physical interference among \nother effects. In spite of food abundance, large colonies sometimes exhaust their \nlocal food supplies and abandon their nests. Large groups also attract predators, \nespecially raptors, and facilitate the spread of parasites and diseases. The globular \nmud nests in large colonies of the American cliff swallow, for example, are more \nlikely to be infested by fleas or other bloodsucking parasites than are nests in small \ncolonies. Experiments in which some burrows were fumigated to kill the parasites \nshowed that these parasites lowered survivorship by as much as 50 percent in large \ncolonies but not significantly in small ones. The swallows inspect and then select \nparasite-free nests. In large colonies, they tend to build new nests rather than use \nold, infested ones. On balance, the advantages of colonial nesting clearly outweigh \nthe disadvantages, given the many times at which colonial nesting has evolved \nindependently among different groups of birds. Still lacking, however, is a general \nframework for testing different hypotheses for the evolution of coloniality.",

      "content": "When human beings first migrated from Asia into North America at the end of the \nlast ice age, they found an enormous, now extinct creature known as the giant \nlong-horned bison (Bison priscus). We know that early Americans hunted these \nbeasts because excavated skeletons of the bison bear stone spear tips. The style of \nthe points dates them to twelve to thirteen thousand years ago, not long after the first \nwave of human immigrants washed south and east across the continent. These early \nAmericans ate a variety of plants and animals, but judging from the campsite \nremains, they had a special taste for long-horned bison. It was their favorite prey, \nperhaps because one animal filled so many stomachs. \nThe giant horns that gave Bison priscus its common name tell us some important \nthings about its lifestyle. Animals with gigantic weapons on their heads usually live \nalone or in small groups. Animals that live in herds usually have small horns. Horns \nand antlers help males in several ways. Animals use these horns and antlers to fight \nwith other members of the same species, to increase their appeal to potential mates, \nand to protect themselves from predators. Fossil bones suggest that giant bison \nused their long, outward-facing horns to injure their opponents. An individual with \nlonger horns had a better chance of circumventing its opponents' horns and fatally \nwounding them than one with shorter horns, and females probably preferred to mate \nwith winners of these contests rather than with losers, either because they liked what \nthey saw in the male or because they liked the territory that the male could defend \nfrom competitors. \nThe giant bison's architecture served it well for thousands of years, but its body \nshrank and changed shape, starting about twelve thousand years ago. The timing \ngives us an important clue about the cause. Only two major predators, wolves and \nlions, had hunted giant bison for tens of thousands of years. If they caused the \nchange, it would have happened much earlier. The big change in the bison's \nenvironment twelve to thirteen thousand years ago was the arrival of a new predator. \nThis one walked on two feet, hunted in cooperative bands, and carried spears with \nwell-designed stone points. Its remarkable efficiency at hunting seems to have \ncaused a reduction in the body size of other large mammals, too. Over the past ten \nthousand years, North American sheep, elk, moose, musk ox, bears, antelope, and \nwolves have all shrunk. \nScholars have offered various explanations for these changes, but it seems likely \nthat these new hunters converted the giant bison's shape and habits from virtues into \nliabilities. Hunters who needed to get close to their prey, such as wolves and human \nbeings armed with spears, preferred to attack lone individuals rather than many \nvictims at once. Hunting punished solitary, territorial giant bison and rewarded those \nthat stayed close together. Clumps of bison became more common and grew into \nherds. \nHerding is a classic response to heavy predation. It brings a statistical advantage to \nherd members because the odds that a predator will hone in on any one individual \nwill decrease with the size of the herd. Herds further improved odds for members \nthrough cooperative behavior. Members warned each other of danger, and they \nfought off predators by joining forces (e.g., by forming a circle with vulnerable \nbacksides to the center and dangerous horns facing the periphery). \nBut bison paid a price for herding. In a given area, the supply of food per individual \ndeclined along with the chances of being attacked. Smaller bodies probably resulted \nfrom a decline in food availability as bison crowded together. Herding changed the \nbison's shape as well as size. Now survival depended on the ability to crop grass, \nbison's main food, quickly. Shifting the head closer to the ground, reducing horn size, \nand growing a hump to cantilever, or support, the head's weight enabled bison to \ngraze for long periods without strain. Giant horns, which enabled males to defend \nterritory, may also have become a liability as being able to stay close together \nbecame more valuable.",

      "title": "Dinosaurs and Parental Care",
      "content": "From fossil evidence alone the question of whether or not dinosaurs cared for their \nyoung is very difficult to answer. Because behaviors are not preserved in the fossil \nrecord, we can only make inferences from indirect evidence. Parental care can be \ndivided into two types of behavior: prehatching (building nests and incubating \neggs—for example, sitting on top of them so as to warm the eggs and encourage \nhatching) and posthatching (feeding the young and guarding the nests). Most of our \nevidence comes from alleged dinosaur rookeries (places where nests are built). \nSeveral have been excavated in eastern Montana, where a large concentration of \ndinosaur nests was found at a place now called Egg Mountain. Most of these \nprobably belonged to the hadrosaur Maiasaura. Preserved in these nests are the \nbones of baby dinosaurs. The finds at Egg Mountain and other sites around the \nworld document that dinosaurs laid their eggs in nests. \nThe nests at Egg Mountain are reported to be equally spaced, separated by a space \ncorresponding to the length of an adult Maiasaura. From this arrangement scientists \nhave inferred that the nests were separated in this way to allow incubation in a tightly \npacked nesting colony. Although this interpretation is open to challenge, the \ndiscovery of Oviraptor adults on top of Oviraptor egg clutches (as determined by \nembryos in some eggs) is relatively powerful evidence that at least these dinosaurs \nincubated their nests. \nEvidence for parental care following hatching is much more controversial. Behavioral \nspeculation based on indirect fossil evidence is dangerous because the data are not \nalways as unambiguous as might appear. At Egg Mountain, many nests contain \nbaby dinosaur bones. Not all the dinosaurs in the nest are the same size. Many of \nthe small bones found in the nests are associated with jaws and teeth, teeth that \nshow signs of wear. It seems reasonable to assume that the wear was caused by the \nchewing of the coarse plants that were the hatchlings' diet. Because the young were \nstill in the nest, this food may have been brought to the rookery by foraging adults. \nThis line of reasoning suggests that these animals had an advanced system of \nparental care. A closer look at the evidence clouds this interpretation. Analysis of \ndinosaur embryos indicates that worn surfaces are present on the teeth of juveniles \neven before hatching. Just as a human baby moves inside the mother before birth, \nmodern-day archosaurs also grind their teeth before birth, wearing the surface in \nsome spots. Thus, the fossil evidence for an advanced parental care system in \nextinct dinosaurs is suggestive but inconclusive, and it is hard even to imagine the \nsort of paleontologic discovery that could settle this debate for good. \nThe strongest evidence that extinct dinosaurs had some form of advanced parental \ncare system is based on an understanding of the phylogenetic relationships among \ndinosaurs and their closest living relatives. Living dinosaurs (birds), even primitive \nones such as ostriches and kiwis, exhibit parental care, so some form of parental \ncare can be inferred to have existed in the last common ancestor of all birds. \nAlthough unappreciated, crocodiles are reptiles that are also caring parents. They \nbuild nests, guard the nests, and in some cases dig their young out of the nest when \nthey hear the chirping young ones hatching. The young even communicate with each \nother while still in the egg by high-frequency squeaks (as birds do). Some evidence \nsuggests that this squeaking is a cue for the synchronization of the hatching. Since \nbirds and crocodiles share a common ancestor, the simplest explanation for the \ncharacteristics they share (such as nest building and some form of parental care) is \nthat they evolved only once—that these attributes were present in their common \nancestor and passed on to its descendants. Because extinct dinosaurs also \ndescended from that ancestor, the simplest and most general theory is that extinct \ndinosaurs also shared these characteristics, even though they cannot be directly \nobserved, and we cannot be sure how elaborate their parental care was.",

      "title": "Human Impacts on Biogeography",
      "content": "Biologists, who commonly study the distribution of plant and animal species in \ndifferent environments—their biogeography—strive to develop interpretations or \nexplanations of the patterns of species distribution, but these may be incorrect if the \neffects of human beings are not taken into consideration. In some cases, these \neffects may be accidental; for example, some species of rat were unintentionally \ntransported aboard ships from Europe to the islands of the South Pacific. In other \ncases, species distributions may have been deliberately modified by human beings. \nThe Polynesians in the South Pacific intentionally moved the kumara (sweet potato) \nto islands in that region to provide the population with a new food crop. \nThe relocation of species by humans (and more recently the imposition of restrictions \non movement by way of national controls and world conventions) has been primarily \nfor economic reasons and for environmental protection. For example, humans \nintroduced Sitka spruce trees into Scotland and England from North America to use \nthem as a timber crop. Similarly, the Monterey pine tree was introduced into New \nZealand in the nineteenth century from California and has become the most widely \nused species in the timber production industry in that country. The potato has been \ncarried from its native home in the high Andes of South America, modified and \ndeveloped into many varieties, and transported around the world because it can be \nused as a food crop. The plant formerly known as the Chinese gooseberry was \nrelocated from its native China to New Zealand where an industry was established \naround the renamed kiwifruit. \nWe have extended the distribution of some species because of certain useful traits \nthat make the species desirable beyond their former known range. For example, \nwillows have extensive root systems, can grow relatively quickly, and are now used \nin several countries worldwide to stabilize river margins as a flood protection \nmeasure. The distribution of willows has therefore been influenced considerably by \nhuman use in river bank management. \nThe effects of introduced species can be many and varied and can include effects on \nthe distribution of other species. For example, the North American gray squirrel was \nintroduced into England and has now largely displaced the native red squirrel. The \naccidental introduction of organisms to new areas may have major pest implications. \nThe South African bronze butterfly, the larva (immature insect forms) of which feed \non buds and other parts of geraniums and similar flowers, was accidentally \nintroduced into the Balearic Islands via imported geraniums. In its native South \nAfrica, the distribution and abundance of the butterfly are affected in part by a native \nwasp that parasitizes (feeds on) the larvae. In the absence of the parasite wasp on \nthe Balearic Islands off the coast of Spain, the butterfly has now spread to mainland \nSpain where its rapid spread has been accentuated by trade in garden plants and \nmodern transport. The species has become a major pest due to the lack of a natural \npredator and is now causing great problems for the horticultural industry in Spain. \nHuman-driven changes in the distribution of some species may result in hybridization \n(interbreeding) with other species and so have a genetic effect. For example, the \nNorth American cord grass was accidentally introduced to the south coast of \nEngland in the early nineteenth century. It hybridized with the European cord grass \nand resulted in the production of a new species, which in this case is also a major \npest plant of estuaries in England where it became dominant and extensive. \nInformation about a species' distribution (prior to human modification) may be \napplied in pest control programs for the introduced species. Studies of the species in \nits native habitat may yield information about the factors that limit or influence its \ndistribution and population dynamics. That information may then be applied in the \ndevelopment of strategies to contain and control the spread of pest species. For \nexample, information about the role of the parasitic wasp in the ecology of the \nbronze butterfly may be utilized in the process of finding control strategies for that \nspecies on mainland Spain.",

      "title": "The Cambrian Explosion",
      "content": "The earliest fossil evidence for eukaryotes—complex organisms whose cells contain \na distinct nucleus—dates to only about 1.2 billion years ago. The fossil record \nsuggests that animal evolution progressed slowly, with relatively little change seen \nbetween fossils from 1.2 billion years ago and those from a half-billion years later. \nBut then something quite dramatic happened as can be judged by the many different \nanimal groups that suddenly appear in the fossil record. \nBiologists classify animals according to their basic body plans. For example, the \nbasic body plan shared by mammals and reptiles is fundamentally different from that \nof insects. Animals are grouped by body plan into what biologists call phyla. \nMammals and reptiles both belong to the single phylum Chordata, which includes \nanimals with internal skeletons. Insects, crabs, and spiders belong to the phylum \nArthropoda, which contains animals with body features such as jointed legs, an \nexternal skeleton, and segmented bodies. Classifying animals into phyla is an \nongoing project for biologists, but modern animals appear to comprise about 30 \ndifferent phyla, each representing a different body plan. \nRemarkably, nearly all of these different body plans, plus a few others that have \ngone extinct, make their first known appearance in the geological record during a \nperiod spanning only about 40 million years—less than about 1 percent of Earth's \nhistory. This remarkable flowering of animal diversity appears to have begun about \n545 million years ago, which corresponds to the start of the Cambrian period. Hence \nit is called the Cambrian explosion. \nThe fact that the Cambrian explosion marks the only major diversification of body \nplans in the geological record presents us with two important and related questions: \nWhy, so long after the origin of eukaryotes, did the pace of evolution suddenly \naccelerate dramatically at the beginning of the Cambrian, and why hasn't there been \nanother period of similarly explosive diversification since then? \nWe can identify at least four factors that might have contributed to the Cambrian \nexplosion. First, the oxygen level in our atmosphere may have remained well below \nits present level until about the time of the Cambrian explosion. Thus, the rapid \ndiversification in animal life may have occurred at least in part because oxygen \nreached a critical level for the survival of larger and more energy-intensive life forms. \nA second factor that may have been important was the evolution of genetic \ncomplexity. As eukaryotes evolved, they developed more and more genetic variation \nin their DNA. Some scientists believe that the Cambrian explosion marks the point at \nwhich organisms developed certain kinds of homeobox genes that control body form \nand that could be combined in different ways, allowing the evolution of a great \ndiversity of forms over time. \nA third factor may have been climate change. Geological evidence points to a series \nof episodes in which Earth froze over before the Cambrian began. The extreme \nclimate conditions of these episodes eliminated many species, leaving a wide array \nof ecological niches available into which new species could rapidly evolve when \nclimate conditions eased at the beginning of the Cambrian. \nA fourth factor may have been the absence of efficient predators. Early predatory \nanimals were probably not very sophisticated, so some evolving animals that later \nmight have been eliminated by predation were given a chance to survive, making the \nbeginning of the Cambrian period a window of opportunity for many different \nadaptations to establish themselves in the environment. \nThis last idea may partly explain why no similar explosion of diversity has taken \nplace since the Cambrian: once predators were efficient and widespread, it may \nhave been virtually impossible for animals with entirely new body forms to find an \nenvironmental niche in which they could escape predation. Or it may be that while \nmore body plans may have been possible at some early point in evolution, it was not \npossible to evolve into those other body plans from the body plans that evolved in \nthe Cambrian. Or perhaps the various body forms that arose during the Cambrian \nexplosion represent the full range of forms possible given the basic genetic \nresources that characterize all Earth's organisms. In any case, no fundamentally new \nbody forms have emerged since the Cambrian explosion.",

      "title": "The Extinction of the Dinosaurs",
      "content": "Geologists define the boundary between sediment layers of the Cretaceous period \n(144-65 million years ago) and the Paleocene period (65-55 million years ago) in part \nby the types and amounts of rocks and fossils they contain or lack. Before the limit of \n65 million years ago, marine strata are rich in calcium carbonate due to \naccumulations of fossils of microscopic algae deposited on the sea floor. Above the \n65-million-year limit, sea-floor sediments contain much less calcium carbonate. This \nchange indicates that something happened in the oceans to drastically reduce the \nabundance of these algae. At the same time, many species that lived in the oceans \ndisappeared forever. On land, the most dramatic extinction was that of the dinosaurs, \nbut many other animals and plants also became extinct. In all, about half of all living \nthings disappeared in what is called the K-T extinction event. \nFor a long time, scientists have argued that the extinction of the dinosaurs was \nrelated to climate change. But what caused the climate to change? In 1980, a team \nof scientists led by Luis Alvarez proposed a startling hypothesis: the dinosaurs and \nmany other organisms were killed by the effects of a giant asteroid striking Earth. \nThe evidence for this hypothesis came from a thin layer of clay found in rocks around \nthe world at the exact level of the K-T boundary. This clay layer is enriched in the \nelement iridium, which is rare on Earth's surface but common in asteroids and \ncomets. The Alvarez team argued that the iridium came from the asteroid itself, \nwhich vaporized on impact and spread its dust around the globe. \nThe asteroid impact hypothesis gained support when scientists discovered a huge \nimpact crater of the right age at Chicxulub on Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula. The \nChicxulub crater is about 180 kilometers in diameter, which is the size expected from \nan asteroid about 10 kilometers across. The impact would have released energy \nequivalent to millions of nuclear bombs, throwing huge amounts of dust and debris \ninto the atmosphere. This dust would have blocked sunlight for months or even \nyears, stopping photosynthesis and causing a dramatic drop in temperature. The \nresulting darkness and cold would have killed many plants and the animals that \ndepended on them, leading to the mass extinction. \nHowever, not all scientists accept the asteroid impact hypothesis. Some point out \nthat the fossil record shows that many dinosaur species were already in decline long \nbefore the end of the Cretaceous. They argue that volcanic activity may have been \nthe primary cause of the extinction. At the end of the Cretaceous, there was massive \nvolcanic activity in what is now India, creating the Deccan Traps—a vast region of \nlava flows thousands of meters thick. This volcanic activity would have released \nhuge amounts of sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, causing \nrapid climate change. The sulfur dioxide would have caused cooling, while the \ncarbon dioxide would have caused warming. Such dramatic climate swings could \nhave stressed ecosystems and led to extinctions. \nThe volcanic eruptions that formed the Deccan Traps were unlike most volcanic \neruptions today, which occur as relatively small, localized events. The Deccan \nvolcanism was a flood basalt eruption, in which huge volumes of lava poured out of \nlong fissures in the Earth's crust, covering vast areas. These eruptions were not \nsingle events but occurred in pulses over hundreds of thousands of years. Each \npulse would have injected enormous amounts of volcanic gases into the \natmosphere, causing rapid climate changes. Supporters of the volcanic hypothesis \nargue that these repeated climate shocks could have gradually weakened dinosaur \npopulations, making them vulnerable to eventual extinction. \nThe volcanic convulsion that buried the Deccan plateau in lava must also have \nchanged the composition of the atmosphere and severely affected climate. Initially, \nthere must have been strong sudden cooling resulting from the blocking of sunlight \nby sulfate aerosol veils in the stratosphere (part of the Earth's atmosphere). If strong \ncooling lasted a year after the formation of the aerosols, it would have been the \ndeath of tropical species unable to adapt to such a volcanic winter. However, a long \nperiod of strong volcanic activity would at the same time have added a substantial \namount of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, reinforcing the greenhouse effect. This \nwould gradually warm things up, ending the extended cold-snap and producing \nglobal warming together with geographic shifts of humid and arid (dry) zones. \nCertainly things would change to upset living conditions, leading to the extinction of \nsome species while others would profit, if only from the disappearance of predators.",

      "title": "The First Eyes",
      "content": "Putting a date on the first appearance of eyes depends on what one means by eye. \nIf the term refers to a multicellular organ, even if it has just a few cells, then by \ndefinition, eyes could not form before there were multicellular animals. But many \nprotists (animal-like, plantlike, or fungus-like unicellular organisms that require a \nwater-based environment) can detect light by using aggregations of pigment \nmolecules, and they use this information to modify their metabolic activity or motility \n(the ability to move spontaneously and independently). One of the familiar living \nexamples, probably known to anyone who has taken a biology class, is the aquatic \nprotozoan Euglena, which has an eyespot near its motile flagellum (hair-like \nstructure). Some living protists are very like their ancestral forms embedded in \nancient sedimentary rocks, and this similarity suggests that the ability to detect light \nand modify behavior in response to light has been around for a very long time. \nAnimals arose from one of such unicellular creatures, perhaps from one already \nspecialized for a primitive kind of vision. \nAn eye is a collection of cells that are specialized for light detection through the \npresence of photosensitive pigment as well as a means of restricting the direction of \nincoming light that will strike the photosensitive cells. This definition says nothing \nabout image formation, lenses, eye movements, or any of the other features we \nassociate with our own eyes, but it does recognize the simplest form of functional \nand anatomical specialization, namely, detection of light. Everything else can be built \nup from this simple beginning, and some animals appear to have had eyes almost \nfrom the beginning of the animal kingdom. \nAnimals were scarce 600 million years ago in the geological era called the \nPrecambrian. There are very few fossil remains from that time (though more keep \nturning up), and most evidence of the presence of animals is indirect, such as small \ntunnels in rock that could be ancient worm burrowings. But just 50 million years or so \nlater, fossilized bits and pieces of animals abound, suggesting that a great burst of \nevolutionary creativity occurred in the 50-million-year interval. This surge of new life, \nmarked by an abundance of animals, is called the Cambrian explosion. \nThe first direct evidence for the early origin of eyes comes from fossils that are about \n530 million years old, a time shortly after the Cambrian explosion; they were found \non a mountainside in British Columbia in a deposit known as the Burgess Shale. The \nBurgess Shale fossils are extraordinarily important because among them are \nremains of soft-bodied creatures, many of them lacking shells and other hard parts \nthat fossilize easily. Consequently, their preservation is little short of miraculous (as \nare the delicate methods used to reconstruct three-dimensional structure from these \nflattened fossils), and they are one of the few known repositories of early soft-bodied \nanimals. \nNot all of the Burgess animals had eyes. However, some did. (Gross \nfeatures—location, size, and hemispheric shape—are responsible for the \ndesignation of some structures as eyes.) The reconstructed eyes of these Burgess \nanimals look superficially like eyes of some living crustaceans, particularly those of \nshrimp and crabs whose eyes are mounted on stalks that improve the range of vision \nby raising the eyes above the surface of the head. The eyes of some Burgess \norganisms sat on stalks; those of others were on or a part of the body surface. One \nanimal, Opabinia, had five eyes: two lateral pairs and a single medial eye; at least \none of the lateral pairs had stalks that could have been movable. And some \ntrilobite-like animals in the Burgess Shale had faceted eyes much like those of later \nfossil trilobites. \nAlthough the presence of eyes on some of the Burgess animals indicates that eyes \nhave been around for a very long time, it is unlikely that these were the first eyes; \nthey seem much too large and (potentially) well developed to be brand new \ninventions. The best we can do is put the origin of eyes somewhere between the \nbeginning of the Cambrian explosion, about 600 million years ago, and the death of \nthe Burgess animals, some 530 million years ago.",

      "title": "The Geographical Distribution of Gliding Animals",
      "content": "Southeast Asia has a unique abundance and diversity of gliding animals: flying \nsquirrels, flying frogs, and flying lizards with wings of skin that enable them to glide \nthrough the tropical forest. What could be the explanation for the great diversity in \nthis region and the scarcity of such animals in other tropical forests? Gliding has \ngenerally been viewed as either a means of escaping predators, by allowing animals \nto move between trees without descending to the ground, or as an energetically \nefficient way of traveling long distances between scattered resources. But what is \nspecial about Southeast Asian rain forests? \nScientists have proposed various theories to explain the diversity of gliding animals \nin Southeast Asia. The first theory might be called the tall-trees hypothesis. The \nforests of Southeast Asia are 6 meters taller than forests elsewhere due to the \ndomination of the dipterocarp family: a family of tall tropical hardwood trees. Taller \ntrees could allow for longer glides and the opportunity to build up speed in a dive \nbefore gliding. The lower wind speeds in tall-tree forests might also contribute by \nproviding a more advantageous situation for gliding between trees. This argument \nhas several flaws, however. First, gliding animals are found throughout the \nSoutheast Asian region, even in relatively short-stature forests found in the northern \nrange of the rain forest in China, Vietnam, and Thailand. Some gliders also thrive in \nlow secondary forests, plantations, and even city parks. Clearly, gliding animals do \nnot require tall trees for their activities. In addition, many gliding animals begin their \nglides from the middle of tree trunks, not even ascending to the tops of trees to take \noff. \nA second theory, which we might call the broken-forest hypothesis, speculates that \nthe top layer of the forest—the tree canopy—has fewer woody vines connecting tree \ncrowns in Southeast Asian forests than in New World and African forests. As a \nresult, animals must risk descending to the ground or glide to move between trees. \nIn addition, the tree canopy is presumed to be more uneven in height in Asian \nforests, due to the presence of the tall dipterocarp trees with lower trees between \nthem, again favoring gliding animals. Yet ecologists who work in different regions of \nthe world observe tremendous local variation in tree height, canopy structure, and \nabundance of vines, depending on the site conditions of soil, climate, slope \nelevation, and local disturbance. One can find many locations in Southeast Asia \nwhere there are abundant woody vines and numerous connections between trees \nand similarly many Amazonian forests with few woody vines. \nA final theory differs from the others in suggesting that it is the presence of \ndipterocarp trees themselves that is driving the evolution of gliding species. \nAccording to this view, dipterocarp forests can be food-deserts for the animals that \nlive in them. The animals living in dipterocarp forests that have evolved gliding \nconsist of two main feeding groups: leaf eaters and carnivores that eat small prey \nsuch as insects and small vertebrates. For leaf-eating gliders the problem is not the \nabsence of any leaves but the desert-like absence of edible leaves. Dipterocarp \ntrees often account for 50 percent or more of the total number of canopy trees in a \nforest and over 95 percent of the large trees, yet dipterocarp leaves are unavailable \nto most vertebrate plant eaters because of the high concentration of toxic chemicals \nin their leaves. Many species of gliding animals avoid eating dipterocarp leaves and \nso must travel widely through the forest, bypassing the dipterocarp trees, to find the \nleaves they need to eat. And gliding is a more efficient manner of traveling between \ntrees than descending to the ground and walking or else jumping between trees. \nMany carnivorous animals also may need to search more widely for food due to the \nlower abundance of insects and other prey. This is caused by dipterocarps' irregular \nflowering and fruiting cycles of two- to seven-year intervals, causing a scarcity of the \nflowers, fruits, seeds, and seedlings that are the starting point of so many food \nchains. The lower abundance of prey in dipterocarp forests forces animals such as \nlizards and geckos to move between tree crowns in search of food, with gliding being \nthe most efficient means.",

      "title": "Vocalization in Frogs",
      "content": "The túngara frog is a small terrestrial vertebrate that is found in Central America. \nTúngara frogs breed in small pools, and breeding groups range from a single male to \nchoruses of several hundred males. The advertisement call of a male túngara frog is \na strange noise, a whine that starts at a frequency of 900 hertz and sweeps \ndownward to 400 hertz in about 400 milliseconds. The whine may be produced by \nitself, or it may be followed by one or several chucks or clucking sounds. When a \nmale túngara frog is calling alone in a pond, it usually gives only the whine portion of \nthe call, but as additional males join a chorus, more and more of the frogs produce \ncalls that include chucks. Scientists noted that male túngara frogs calling in a \nbreeding pond added chucks to their calls when they heard the recorded calls of \nother males played back. That observation suggested that it was the presence of \nother calling males that incited frogs to make their calls more complex by adding \nchucks to the end of the whine. \nWhat advantage would a male frog in a chorus gain from using a whine-chuck call \ninstead of a whine? Perhaps the complex call is more attractive to female frogs than \nthe simple call. Michael Ryan and Stanley Rand tested that hypothesis by placing \nfemale túngara frogs in a test arena with a speaker at each side. One speaker \nbroadcast a pre-recorded whine call, and the second speaker broadcast a \nwhine-chuck. When female frogs were released individually in the center of the \narena, fourteen of the fifteen frogs tested moved toward the speaker broadcasting \nthe whine-chuck call. \nIf female frogs are attracted to whine-chuck calls in preference to whine calls, why do \nmale frogs give whine-chuck calls only when other males are present? Why not \nalways give the most attractive call possible? One possibility is that whine-chuck \ncalls require more energy than whines, and males save energy by only using \nwhine-chucks when competition with other males makes the energy expenditure \nnecessary. However, measurements of the energy expenditure of calling of male \ntúngara frogs showed that energy cost was not related to the number of chucks. \nAnother possibility is that male frogs giving whine-chuck calls are more vulnerable to \npredators than frogs giving only whine calls. Túngara frogs in breeding choruses are \npreyed upon by a species of frog-eating bats, Trachops cirrhosus, and it was \ndemonstrated that the bats locate the frogs by homing on their vocalizations. \nIn a series of playback experiments, Michael Ryan and Merlin Tuttle placed pairs of \nspeakers in the forest and broadcast vocalizations of túngara frogs. One speaker \nplayed a recording of a whine and the other a recording of a whine-chuck. The bats \nresponded as if the speakers were frogs: they flew toward the speakers and even \nlanded on them. In five experiments at different sites, the bats approached speakers \nbroadcasting whine-chuck (168 approaches versus 81). Thus, female frogs are not \nalone in finding whine-chuck calls more attractive than simple whines—an important \npredator of frogs also responds more strongly to the complex calls. \nRyan and his colleagues measured the rates of predation in túngara frog choruses of \ndifferent sizes. Large choruses of frogs did not attract more bats than small \nchoruses, and consequently the risk of predation for an individual frog was less in a \nlarge chorus than in a small one. Predation was an astonishing 19 percent of the \nfrogs per night in the smallest chorus and a substantial 1.5 percent per night even in \nthe largest chorus. When a male frog shifts from a simple whine to a whine-chuck \ncall, it increases its risk of attracting a female, but it simultaneously increases its risk \nof attracting a predator. In small choruses, the competition from other males for \nfemales is relatively small, and the risk of predation is relatively large. Under these \nconditions it is apparently advantageous for a male túngara frog to give simple \nwhines. However, as chorus size increases, competition with other males also \nincreases while the risk of predation falls. In that situation, the advantage of giving a \ncomplex call apparently outweighs the risks.",

      "title": "How Trees Shed Their Branches",
      "content": "One way trees prevent themselves from having too many branches is simply by \nshedding (dropping off) branches once they have fulfilled their purpose. This \nhappens as the tree gets bigger and grows new outer layers of foliage that shade the \ninner and lower branches. In most large trees, the center of the canopy contains only \nlarge branches; small branches and fine twigs are found only at the canopy's edge. \nIn the shaded center, the small branches that would once have occupied that space \nare long gone. Trees like the true cypresses regularly shed small twigs complete with \nleaves toward the end of summer. Most other trees shed only branches that prove \nunproductive. If a branch is not producing enough carbohydrate to cover its own \nrunning costs—i.e., it needs to be subsidized by other branches because, for \nexample, it is being shaded and receives little light—it will usually be got rid of. This \nprevents unproductive branches from being a drain on the tree and removes the \nwind drag (the force of air resistance) from useless branches. \nBranches are shed for reasons other than lack of light. In dry parts of the world, it is \ncommon for trees and shrubs to lose smaller branches to save water. Small \nbranches have the thinnest bark (the protective outer covering of a tree) and greatest \nsurface area and thus are the source of most water loss once the leaves have been \nlost. The creosote bush of United States deserts self-prunes, or removes parts of \nitself, in the face of extreme heat or drought, starting from the highest and most \nexposed twigs and working downward to bigger and bigger branches; it's a \ndesperate act because if the creosote bush loses too much wood, it dies. Shedding \nbranches can also be useful for self-propagation. Most poplar trees and willow trees \ncharacteristic of waterways will readily drop branches, which take root when washed \nup on muddy banks further downstream. \nHow are branches shed? In the simplest cases, dead branches rot and fall off, or \nhealthy branches are snapped off by wind, snow, and animals. Some willows have a \nbrittle zone at the base of small branches that encourages breaking in the wind, \nseemingly for propagation. Other cases of \"natural pruning\" are more startling: elm \ntrees, and to a certain extent, others, such as oaks, have a reputation for dropping \nlarge branches (up to half a meter in diameter) with no warning on calm, hot \nafternoons. Such dramatic shedding appears to be due to a combination of internal \nwater stress coupled with heat expansion affecting cracks and decayed wood. \nMany trees, however, shed branches deliberately. In this situation, branches are \nshed in the same way as foliage in autumn by the prior formation of a corky layer \nthat leaves the wound sealed over with cork, which in turn is overgrown with wood \nthe following year. In hardwoods, branches up to a meter in length and several \ncentimeters in diameter can be shed normally after the leaves have fallen in the \nautumn (maples are unusual in casting branches mainly in spring and early \nsummer). Oaks tend to shed small twigs up to the thickness of a pencil, beech may \nshed larger ones, and birches dump whole branches of dead twigs. Pine trees shed \ntheir clusters of needles (which really are short branches), and members of the \nredwood family shed their small branchlets with leaves. Typically, in hardwood trees, \nsomething around 10 percent of terminal branches are lost each year through a \nmixture of deliberate shedding and being broken off. \nAnother way of reducing potential congestion is to make some branches smaller \nthan others. Branches in the shade grow smaller than those in the sun. But trees can \nalso regulate branch length from within. In many trees there is a clear distinction \nbetween long and short branches or shoots. The long shoots build the framework of \nthe tree, making it bigger. The job of the short shoots (called spur shoots by \nhorticulturists) is to produce leaves, and commonly flowers, at more or less the same \nposition every year. To maintain flexibility, any one shoot can switch from long to \nshort or vice versa depending on internal factors, light levels, and damage.",

      "title": "Art and Culture of Pacific Northwest Communities",
      "content": "The 1,600-kilometer stretch of the northwestern Pacific coast of North America (from \nsouthern Alaska to Washington State) provided an ideal environment for the growth \nof stable communities. Despite the northerly latitude, the climate is temperate. \nNatural resources were originally so rich that the inhabitants could subsist by fishing \nand hunting and gathering, without the need for agriculture. The sea provided a \nvariety of fish, shellfish, and marine mammals. The land provided deer, bears, \nmountain goats, and moose, as well as roots and berries. Most importantly, the \nforests provided western red cedar, a wood that could be split into planks for building \nhouses, carved into monumental sculptures, and made into huge dugout canoes \ncapable of carrying forty or more people on long voyages. With such abundance, the \npeople of this region developed a complex society with a rich artistic tradition. \nThe peoples of the Northwest Coast spoke many different languages belonging to a \nnumber of distinct language families. These languages were mutually unintelligible, \nmeaning that speakers of one language could not understand speakers of another. \nNevertheless, the various groups shared many cultural traits. They had similar social \nstructures, with ranked societies consisting of nobles, commoners, and slaves. They \nhad similar religious beliefs and ceremonies, including the potlatch, a grand \nceremonial feast at which the host gave away or destroyed vast amounts of property \nto demonstrate his wealth and status. They also shared a distinctive artistic style, \ncharacterized by the use of bold, flowing forms and the representation of animals \nand supernatural beings. \nThe peoples of the Northwest engaged in trade as well as warfare with one another, \nand this may account for the diffusion of cultural traits and artistic motifs throughout \nthe area. Much of their art was concerned with religious ritual objects. But the rest is \nsecular and springs from a preoccupation with the hereditary basis of their complex \nsocial structures. Art proclaimed the status of its owner and illustrated the myths and \nlegends that validated his right to that status. The artist's task was not to innovate but \nto represent the traditional forms accurately, for any deviation might weaken the \npower of the object and the claim of the owner to his hereditary privileges. \nTotem poles, the most distinctive artistic product of the Northwest, were conspicuous \ndeclarations of prestige and of the genealogy (family history) by which it had been \nattained. These magnificent sculptures that probably originated as funerary \nmonuments were first described by travelers in the late eighteenth century. Each one \nwas carved from a single trunk of cedar, and the increasing availability of metal tools \nboth permitted and encouraged more complex compositions and greater height—up \nto 27.4 meters. Their superimposed figures—eagles, beavers, whales, and so \non—were crests (symbols of identity) that a chief inherited from his lineage, his clan, \nand his moiety. They were not objects of worship, though the animals carved on \nthem might represent guardian spirits. Poles were designed according to a governing \nprinciple of bilateral symmetry, with their various elements interlocked so that they \nseem to grow organically out of one another, creating a unity of symbolism, form, \nand surface. \nMasks are the most varied of the carvings from the Northwest, where they were an \nessential part of communal life. In style they range from an almost abstract \nsymbolism to combinations of human and animal features, and from simple face \ncoverings to elaborate headdresses with movable parts. Some, like the Tlingit war \nhelmets, were actually used in battle. Others, like the transformation masks of the \nKwakiutl, could be opened and closed to reveal different faces, representing the \ntransformation between human and animal spirits. The masks were worn in dances \nthat reenacted the myths of the tribe, and they were considered living entities, \nimbued with the power of the spirits they represented. The masks were often made \nby specialist carvers who inherited the right to carve particular designs. The best \nmasks are masterpieces of design and craftsmanship, combining power and beauty \nin a way that is immediately recognizable as Northwest Coast art. \nThe major differences between masks were determined by their purpose. Some \nwere representations of chiefs and their ancestors and made to be displayed and \ntreasured as heirlooms. Although they appear to record the styles of facial tattooing \ncustomary in different groups, it is difficult to say how far they were intended to be \nportraits rather than generalized images. Many masks, sometimes quite large, were \ncarved to be worn in dance-dramas that re-enacted and kept alive the cohesive \nmyths of a culture. Often, Tlingit masks were made for religious leaders and \nincorporated the animals that were believed to be their spirit helpers. Conjuring up \nforces of nature from the ocean, the forests, or the sky, they mediated between life \non Earth and the inscrutable powers around and above.",

Why? Some scholars seek a single, universal explanation that \nwould be valid for all cases of domestication. Thus, it has been argued that \ndomestication is the outcome of population pressure, as the increasing \nhunting-and-gathering human population overwhelmed the existing food resources. \nOthers point to climate change or famine, as the post-glacial climate got drier. \nIncreasing archaeological research has made it clear, however, that the evidence in \nfavor of any single-cause, universally applicable explanation is not strong. \nSome scholars have proposed universally applicable explanations that take several \ndifferent phenomena into account. One such explanation, called the broad-spectrum \nforaging argument (the argument that humans employed a subsistence strategy \nbased on obtaining a wide range of plants and animals), is based on a reconstruction \nof the environmental situation that followed the retreat of the most recent glaciers. \nThe very large animals of the Ice Age began to die out and were replaced by \nincreased numbers of smaller animals. As sea levels rose to cover the continental \nshelves, fish and shellfish became more plentiful in the warmer, shallower waters. \nThe effects on plants were equally dramatic, as forests and woodlands expanded \ninto new areas. Consequently, scholars argue, people had to change their diets from \nbig-game hunting to broad-spectrum foraging for plants and animals by hunting, \nfishing, and gathering. This broadening of the economy is said to have led to a more \nsecure subsistence base, the emergence of sedentary communities, and a growth in \npopulation. In turn, population growth pressured the resource base of the area, and \npeople were forced to eat so-called third-choice foods, particularly wild grain, which \nwas difficult to harvest and process but which responded to human efforts to \nincrease yields. \nAlthough the broad-spectrum foraging argument seems to describe plant \ndomestication in the New World, the most recent evidence from ancient \nsouthwestern Asia does not support it. There is also evidence for the development of \nbroad-spectrum foraging in Europe, but domestication did not follow. Rather, \ndomesticated crops were brought into Europe by people from southwestern \nAsia—where the broad-spectrum revolution had not occurred. \nA very different argument comes from Barbara Bender, who argues that before \nfarming began, there was competition between local groups to achieve dominance \nover each other through feasting and the expenditure of resources on ritual and \nexchange, engaging in a kind of prehistoric arms race. To meet increasing demands \nfor food and other resources, land use was intensified, and the development of food \nproduction followed. This argument clearly emphasizes social factors, rather than \nenvironmental or technical factors, and takes a localized, regional approach. The \npotlatch (traditional celebrations in which groups gather and give gifts) of the \nindigenous peoples of the northwest coast of North America provides a possible \nanalogy. These people were foragers in a rich environment that enabled them to \nsettle in relatively permanent villages without farming or herding. Competition among \nneighboring groups led to ever more elaborate forms of competitive exchange, with \nincreasingly large amounts of food and other goods being given away at each. As a \nresult, the intensity of resource use increased, though it did not lead to \ndomestication. \nRecently, archaeologists have avoided grand theories claiming that a single, \nuniversal process was responsible for domestication wherever it occurred. Many \nprefer to take a regional approach, searching for causes particular to one area that \nmay or may not apply to other areas. Currently, the most powerful explanations \nseem to be multiple-strand theories that combine local sequences of environmental \nchange, population pressure, and social change. These theories do not try to explain \ndomestication everywhere by the same factors but instead look for the specific \ncombination of factors that operated in each region where domestication \nindependently arose. The evidence from southwestern Asia, for example, suggests \nthat domestication there resulted from a combination of climate change, population \nincrease, and social factors that created a need for more reliable food sources. In \nMesoamerica, a different combination of factors may have been at work.",

      "title": "Hunting and the Settlement of Inner Eurasia",
      "content": "Inner Eurasia refers to the large continental area extending from Russia in the west \nto the Pacific Ocean, and to the north of Iran, India, and most of China. The first \nsystematic colonization of parts of Inner Eurasia occurred about 80,000 to 90,000 \nyears ago, which is relatively late in human history compared with Africa, Europe, \nand southern Asia. Why was it difficult to settle? \nThe long, cold, arid winters of this region's steppes (grass-covered plains) posed two \ndistinctive problems for human settlers. The first was how to keep warm. Humans \nmay have used fire even a million years ago. Presumably their ability to scavenge \nanimal carcasses meant that they could use skins or furs for warmth. However, there \nare no signs of hearths before about 200,000 years ago. This suggests that humans \nused fire opportunistically and had not yet domesticated it enough to survive the \nharsh winters of Ice Age Inner Eurasia. \nThe second, even trickier problem was getting food during the long winters. It was \nnot that Inner Eurasia lacked sources of food. The problem was that the food was of \nthe wrong kind, and it was not always available. Humans could not exploit the \nabundant grasses of the steppes, and most of the edible plants died off in winter. So, \nfor long periods of each year, it was necessary to rely mainly on meat. However, \nhunting is a more difficult, dangerous, and unreliable way of life than gathering. \nAnimals, unlike plants, can evade predators and may even fight back. Hunters must \nalso cover more ground than gatherers. \nSettling Inner Eurasia meant overcoming these difficulties. Systematic and reliable \nhunting methods meant more than the development of new technologies; they also \ndemanded new social structures. According to the formulation of archaeologist Lewis \nBinford, in a typical hunter/collector food-gathering strategy, parties of hunters leave \ncamps with very specific goals in mind, based on intimate knowledge of their \nintended prey. They may be away for days or weeks at a time and will often store \ntheir kill at specific storage sites, from which they will bring food back to a base camp \nwhen needed. As a result, they move their base camps less often than in forager \nsocieties, but they range more widely, their movements are more carefully planned, \nand so are their methods of storage. \nThus, hunters have to plan in advance and in great detail. They need reliable \ninformation about the movements and habits of animal prey over large areas, which \ncan be secured only by maintaining regular contacts with neighboring groups. \nFinally, they need reliable methods of storage because, where plant foods cannot \nprovide a dietary safety net, planning has to be precise and detailed to ensure that \nthere is enough to tide them over in periods of shortage. Such planning appears in \nthe choice of hunting gear, in the selection of routes and prey, in the choice of \ncompanions and timing, in the maintenance of communications with neighbors, and \nin the methods of storage. Failure at any point can be fatal for the entire group. \nHunting strategies also imply greater social complexity. The regular exchange of \ninformation and sometimes of material goods is critical not only within groups, but \nalso between groups scattered over large distances. This increases the importance \nof symbolic exchanges of both goods and information, and makes it necessary to \nclarify group identity. Internally, groups may split for long periods as hunting parties \ntravel over great distances. All in all, each group has to exist and survive in several \ndistinct configurations. \nBefore 120,000 years ago, human communities seem to have been relatively \nisolated from one another. There is little evidence of long-distance exchange of \ngoods or information. Stone tools were made from local materials, and there is little \nvariation in tool types over large areas. This suggests that groups were small and \nwidely scattered, with little contact between them. Such isolation would have made it \ndifficult to maintain the kind of information networks that hunters need to track prey \nover large areas. It would also have made it hard to coordinate hunting strategies or \nto share knowledge about animal behavior. The colonization of Inner Eurasia may \nhave had to wait until humans developed the social structures necessary for \nlong-distance cooperation and communication.",

      "title": "Origins of the Megaliths",
      "content": "Since the days of the earliest antiquarians, scholars have been puzzled by the many \nNeolithic (4000 B.C. ~ 2000 B.C.) communal tombs known as megaliths along \nEurope's Atlantic seaboard. Although considerable variations are found in the \narchitectural form of these impressive monuments, there is a general overriding \nsimilarity in design and, particularly, in the use of massive stones. \nThe construction of such large and architecturally complex tombs by European \nbarbarians struck early prehistorians as unlikely. The Bronze Age seafaring \ncivilizations that lived in the region of the Aegean Sea (3000 B.C. ~ 1000 B.C.), \namong whom collective burial and a diversity of stone-built tombs were known, \nseemed a probable source of inspiration. It was suggested that Aegean people had \nvisited Iberia in southwestern Europe in search of metal ores and had introduced the \nidea of collective burial in massive tombs, which then spread northward to Brittany, \nBritain, North Germany, and Scandinavia. \nRadiocarbon dates for a fortified settlement of megalith builders at Los Millares in \nSpain appeared to confirm this picture, though dates for megaliths in Brittany \nseemed too early. When calibrated, however, it became clear that radiocarbon dates \nwere universally too early to support a Bronze Age Aegean origin. It is now clear that \nthe megaliths are a western and northern European invention, not an introduced \nidea. Even so, they are still a subject of speculation and inquiry. What induced their \nbuilders to invest massive efforts in erecting such monumental tombs? How was the \nnecessary labor force assembled? What underlies their striking similarities? \nOne answer to the last question was proposed by Professor Grahame Clark, one of \nBritain's greatest prehistorians. Investigating the megaliths of southern Sweden, he \nnoted that one group was concentrated in coastal locations from which deep-sea fish \nsuch as cod, haddock, and ling could have been caught in winter. Historically, much \nof the Atlantic was linked by the travels of people who fished, and this could well \nhave provided a mechanism by which the \"megalith idea\" and fashions in the style of \ntomb architecture spread between coastal Iberia, Brittany, Ireland, western England \nand Scotland, and Scandinavia. The high concentrations of megaliths on coasts and \nthe surprising number of megaliths found on small islands may support a connection \nwith fishing. \nProfessor Colin Renfrew of the University of Cambridge, England, however, views \nthe similarities as similar responses to similar needs. At the structural level, the \npassage that forms a major element of many graves could have been devised \nindependently in different areas to meet the need for repeated access to the interior \nof these communal tombs. Other structural resemblances could be due to similarities \nin the raw materials available. In answer to the question of why the idea of building \nmonumental tombs should arise independently in a number of areas, he cites the \nsimilarities in their backgrounds. \nMost megaliths occur in areas inhabited in the postglacial period by Mesolithic \nhunter-gatherers (8500 B.C. ~ 4000 B.C.). Their adoption of agriculture through \ncontact with Neolithic farmers, Renfrew argues, led to a population explosion in the \nregion and consequent competition for farmland between neighboring groups. In the \nface of potential conflict, the groups may have found it desirable to define their \nterritories and emphasize their boundaries. The construction of megaliths could have \narisen in response to this need. \nRenfrew has studied two circumscribed areas, the Scottish islands of Arran and \nRousay, to examine this hypothesis more closely. He found that a division of the \narable land into territories, each containing one megalith, results in units that \ncorrespond in size to the individual farming communities of recent times in the same \narea. Each unit supported between 10 and 50 people. The labor needed to put up a \nmegalith would probably be beyond the capabilities of a community this size. But \nRenfrew argues that the cooperation of other communities could be secured by \nsome form of recognized social incentive—perhaps a period of feasting at which \ncommunal building was one of several activities. \nMost megaliths contain collective burials. Different tombs used different \narrangements, but there seems to have been an underlying theme: people placed in \nthese tombs were representative of their society, but their identity as individuals was \nnot important. The tombs belonged to the ancestors, through whom the living society \nlaid claim to their land. This interpretation reinforces Renfrew's view of the megaliths \nas territorial markers.",

      "content": "Laws of incorporation passed in the United States in the 1830s and 1840s made it \neasier for business organizations to raise money by selling stock to members of the \npublic. The ability to sell stock to a broader public made it possible for entrepreneurs \nto gather vast sums of capital and undertake large projects. This led to the \nemergence of modern corporations as a major force in the United States after 1865. \nThese large, national business enterprises needed more systematic administrative \nstructures. As a result, corporate leaders introduced a set of managerial techniques \nthat relied on systematic division of responsibilities, a carefully designed hierarchy of \ncontrol, careful cost-accounting procedures, and perhaps above all a new breed of \nbusiness executive: the middle manager, who formed a layer of command between \nworkers and owners. Efficient administrative capabilities helped make possible \nanother major feature of the modern corporation: consolidation (combining many \nthings into one). \nBusinessmen created large, consolidated organizations primarily through two \nmethods. One was horizontal integration—the combining of multiple firms engaged \nin the same enterprise into a single corporation. The consolidation of many different \nrailroad lines into one company was an example. Another method, which became \npopular in the 1890s, was vertical integration—the taking over of all the different \nbusinesses on which a company relied for its primary function. Thus, Carnegie Steel \ncontrolled mines and railroads as well as steel mills. \nThe most celebrated corporate empire of the late nineteenth century was John D. \nRockefeller's Standard Oil. Shortly after 1865, Rockefeller launched a refining \ncompany in Cleveland, Ohio, and immediately began trying to eliminate his \ncompetition. Allying himself with other wealthy capitalists, he proceeded methodically \nto buy out competing refineries. In 1870, he formed the Standard Oil Company of \nOhio, which in a few years had acquired twenty of the twenty-five refineries in \nCleveland, as well as plants in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New York, and Baltimore. He \nbuilt his own barrel factories, warehouses, and pipelines. Standard Oil owned its own \nrailroad freight cars and developed its own marketing organization. By the 1880s, \nRockefeller had established such dominance within the petroleum industry that to \nmuch of the nation he served as a leading symbol of monopoly. \nRockefeller and other industrialists saw consolidation as a way to cope with what \nthey believed was the greatest curse of the modern economy, \"cutthroat \ncompetition.\" Most businessmen claimed to believe in free enterprise and a \ncompetitive marketplace, but in fact they feared that substantial competition could \nresult in instability and ruin for all. As the movement toward consolidation \naccelerated, new vehicles emerged to facilitate it. The railroads began with so-called \npool arrangements—informal agreements among various companies to stabilize \nrates and divide markets. But if even a few firms in an industry were unwilling to \ncooperate (as was almost always the case), the pool arrangements collapsed. The \nfailure of the pools led to new techniques of consolidation. At first, the most \nsuccessful such technique was the creation of the \"trust\"—pioneered by Standard Oil \nin the early 1880s and perfected by the banker J. P. Morgan. Under a trust \nagreement, stockholders in individual corporations transferred their stocks to a small \ngroup of trustees in exchange for shares in the trust itself. Owners of trust certificates \noften had no direct control over the decisions of the trustees; they simply received a \nshare of the profits of the combination. The trustees themselves, on the other hand, \nmight literally own only a few companies but could exercise effective control over \nmany. \nIn 1889, the state of New Jersey helped produce a third form of consolidation by \nchanging its laws of incorporation to permit companies to buy up the stock of other \ncompanies. Other states soon followed. These changes made the trust unnecessary \nand permitted actual corporate mergers. Rockefeller, for example, quickly relocated \nStandard Oil to New Jersey and created there what became known as a holding \ncompany—a central corporate body that would buy up the stock of various members \nof the Standard Oil trust and establish direct, formal ownership of the corporations in \nthe trust.",

      "title": "Costs of Quitting a Job",
      "content": "Beyond the costs that can be associated with such measurable characteristics as \nage and residential location are those that are psychic in nature. These latter costs, \nthough unobservable to the researcher, are very likely to differ widely across \nindividuals. Some people adapt more quickly to new surroundings than others do, for \nexample. Recent studies have found considerable heterogeneity among workers in \ntheir propensity to change jobs, with one study reporting that almost half of all \npermanent separations that took place over a three-year period involved a small \nnumber (13 percent) of workers who had three or more separations during the period \n(in contrast, 31 percent of workers had no separations at all during the period). \nIt is also possible that the costs of job changing by employees vary internationally. \nData suggest that workers in the United States may well be more likely to change \nemployers than workers elsewhere may be. Indeed, data confirm that, on average, \nAmerican workers have been with their current employers fewer years than workers \nin most other developed countries, particularly workers in Europe and Japan, have \nbeen with theirs. It is not known why Americans are more mobile than most others \nare, but one possibility relates to the lower levels of company training received by \nAmerican workers. Another possibility, however, is that the costs of mobility are lower \nin the United States (despite the fact that Japan and Europe are more densely \npopulated and hence more urban). What would create these lower costs? \nOne hypothesis that has received at least some investigation is that housing policies \nin Europe and Japan increase the costs of residential, and therefore job, mobility. \nGermany, the United Kingdom, and Japan, for example, have controls on the rent \nincreases that proprietors can charge to existing renters while tending to allow \nproprietors the freedom to negotiate any mutually agreeable rent on their initial lease \nwith the renter. Thus, it is argued that renters who move typically face very large rent \nincreases in these countries. Similarly, subsidized housing is much more common in \nthese countries than in the United States, but since it is limited relative to the \ndemand for it, those British, German, or Japanese workers fortunate enough to live \nin subsidized units are reluctant (it is argued) to give them up. The empirical \nevidence on the implications of housing policy for job mobility, however, is both \nlimited and mixed. \nIt could also be hypothesized that the United States, Australia, and Canada, all of \nwhich exhibit shorter job tenures than do most European countries or Japan, are \nlarge, sparsely populated countries that historically have attracted people willing to \nemigrate from abroad or resettle internally over long distances. In a country of \n\"movers,\" moving may not be seen by either worker or employer as an unusual or \nespecially traumatic event. \nWhile questions remain about the causes of different job mobility rates across \ncountries, the social desirability of job mobility can also be debated. On one hand, \nmobility can be seen as socially useful because it promotes both individual \nwell-being and the quality of job matches. Moreover, the greater the number of \nworkers and employers \"in the market\" at any given time, the more flexibility an \neconomy has in making job matches that best adapt to a changing environment. \nIndeed, when focusing on this aspect of job mobility, economists have long worried \nwhether economies have enough mobility. On the other hand, lower mobility costs \n(and therefore greater mobility) among workers may well serve to reduce the \nincentives of their employers to provide job training. Whether the presence of job \nchanging costs is a social boon or bane, these costs and the mobility associated with \nthem are factors with which all employers must contend.",

      "title": "Controversy about Causing Emotion",
      "content": "The fact that we react to certain experiences with \"emotion\" is obvious. For example, \nthe feeling of embarrassment, which triggers a physiological response that may \ncause blushing, is caused by a foolish act committed in the company of friends. \nAlthough this description of an embarrassed reaction seems logical, the American \npsychologist William James, in 1884, believed that the course of an emotional \nexperience follows another sequence of events. \nFollowing the argument of James, what subjective experience tells us is completely \nopposite to the sequence of events in an emotional experience. First, he insisted that \nboth physiological excitement and physical reaction are generated by an incident. \nOnly then does the individual perceive or interpret the physical response as an \nemotion. That is, we associate blushing that is caused by physical reaction with \nembarrassment, such as saying something silly may cause us to blush. In 1890, \nJames went on to claim that \"people feel sorry because they cry, furious because \nthey strike, afraid because they shudder.\" Simultaneously with James' proposition, \nCarl Lange, a Danish physiologist and psychologist, independently formulated \nvirtually a similar theory. The James-Lange theory of emotion (Lange and James, \n1922) suggests that different patterns of arousal in the autonomic nervous system \ncreate the different emotions people feel, and that physiological arousal occurs prior \nto perceiving the emotion. \nIn 1927, another early theory of emotion that challenged the James-Lange theory \nwas proposed by Walter Cannon. He claimed that physical changes caused by the \ndiverse emotions are not sufficiently distinct to allow people to distinguish one \nemotion from another. After Cannon stated his original theory, in 1934, it was further \ndeveloped by physiologist Philip Bard. The Cannon-Bard theory suggests that the \nfollowing chain of events takes place when an emotion is felt. Stimuli which trigger \nemotion are received by the senses and then are relayed simultaneously to the \ncerebral cortex, which imparts the conscious mental experience of the emotion, and \nto the sympathetic nervous system, which generates the physiological state of \narousal. In other words, the feeling of emotion occurs at roughly the same time as \nthe physiological arousal is experienced. One does not cause the other. \nIn 1962, Schachter and Singer proposed a two-factor theory. Stanley Schachter \nthought that the early theories of emotion excluded a critical component: the \nsubjective cognitive interpretation of why a state of arousal has occurred. According \nto this theory, two things must happen in order for a person to feel an emotion. At \nfirst, the person must experience physiological arousal. Then, for the person to label \nit as a specific emotion, there must be a cognitive interpretation or explanation. Thus, \nSchachter delivered the conclusion that a true emotion can appear only if a person is \nphysically aroused and can find the reason for it. When people are in a state of \nphysiological arousal but do not know why they are aroused, they tend to label the \nstate as an emotion that is appropriate to their situation at the time. There were \nseveral attempts to replicate the findings of this theory, but they have not been \nsuccessful. \nRichard Lazarus, in the 1990s, proposed the emotion theory that most heavily \nemphasizes the cognitive aspect. According to his theory, the first step in an \nemotional response is cognitive appraisal, and all other aspects of emotion, including \nphysiological arousal, rely on the cognitive appraisal. This theory is most compatible \nwith the subjective experience of an emotion's sequence of events—the sequence \nthat William James reversed long ago. People first appraise a stimulus, or an event, \nwhen they encounter it. This cognitive appraisal determines whether the person will \nhave an emotional response, and, if so, what type of response. From this appraisal, \nthe physiological arousal and all other aspects of the emotion arise. In brief, Lazarus \ncontends that emotions are roused when cognitive appraisals of events or \ncircumstances are positive or negative—but not neutral. Some critics criticize the \nLazarus theory by saying that some emotional reactions are instantaneous, which \nmeans they occur too rapidly to pass through a cognitive appraisal. In response to \nthe criticisms, Lazarus remarks that some mental processing occurs without \nconscious awareness, meaning that a person should not know what he or she is \nresponding to or what emotion to feel, or else, some form of cognitive realization \nmust manifest but be brief.",

      "title": "Motor Development in Children",
      "content": "Control over one's motor behavior ranks among the infant's greatest achievements. \nPsychologists who study the acquisition of motor skills in children find it useful to \ndistinguish between gross motor development, that is, motor skills which help \nchildren to get around in their environment such as crawling and walking, and fine \nmotor development, which refers to smaller movement sequences like reaching and \ngrasping. \nThe development of motor skills has implications beyond simply learning how to \nperform new actions: motor skills can have profound effects on other areas of \ndevelopment. For example, researchers have shown that infants with locomotor \nexperience (experience moving around their environment) were less likely to make \nerrors while searching for hidden objects. The ability to initiate movement around \none's environment stimulates the development of memory, making hidden object \ntasks easier to solve. Psychology professor Carolyn Rovee-Collier argues that the \nonset of independent locomotion at around nine months old marks an important \ntransition in memory development. Children who can move about the environment \ndevelop an understanding of locations such as here and there. Because infant \nmemory is initially highly dependent on context, that is, the similarity between the \nsituation where information is encoded (stored in memory) and where it is recalled, \ninfants who have experience moving about the environment and who learn to \nspatially encode information become less dependent on context for successful recall. \nThese examples show that gross motor development has implications beyond the \nimmediately apparent benefits of crawling and walking. \nRenowned psychologist Jean Piaget argued that the development of reaching and \ngrasping was a key aspect of development during the sensorimotor stage, the first \ntwo years of life. Piaget believed that infants initially lack an understanding of object \npermanence—the idea that objects continue to exist even when they are out of sight. \nThe development of reaching and grasping allows infants to act upon objects and to \ndiscover that objects have an independent existence. By around eight months, \ninfants will search for a hidden object, indicating that they have developed some \nunderstanding of object permanence. However, they will often make the \"A-not-B \nerror,\" continuing to search for an object where they last found it (location A) even \nafter watching it being hidden in a new location (location B). By around twelve \nmonths, this error disappears, indicating a more complete understanding of object \npermanence. \nThe development of grasping follows a predictable sequence. Newborns have a \ngrasping reflex; if you place a finger in their palm, they will grasp it tightly. This reflex \ndisappears around two months. By around three to four months, infants begin to \nmake swiping movements toward objects, but they rarely succeed in grasping them. \nBy around five to six months, they can successfully grasp objects, but they use a \nclumsy \"ulnar grasp,\" in which they close their fingers against the palm. By around \nnine months, they develop the ability to use a \"pincer grasp,\" in which they use the \nthumb and index finger to pick up small objects. This fine motor skill allows them to \nexplore objects in more detail and to manipulate their environment in new ways. By \nthe end of the first year, infants can use this grasp to pick up very small objects, such \nas crumbs or small pieces of food, and to manipulate objects with increasing \nprecision. \nThe development of reaching begins early on in life. Newborn infants seated in an \nupright position will swipe and reach toward an object placed in front of them, a \nbehavior labeled \"prereaching.\" These poorly coordinated behaviors start to decline \naround two months of age and are replaced by \"directed reaching\" which begins at \nabout three months of age. At this time reaching becomes more coordinated and \nefficient, and improves in accuracy. According to research conducted by Clifton et al., \nthe infant's reaching does not depend simply on the guidance of the hand and arm \nby the visual system but is controlled by proprioception, the sensation of movement \nand location based on the stimulation arising from bodily sources such as muscle \ncontractions. By about nine months old, infants can adjust their reaching to take into \naccount a moving object. However, nine-month-olds are far from expert reachers. A \ngood deal of skill must still develop.",

      "title": "Documenting the Incas",
      "content": "The Incas ruled a vast empire in western South America when the Spaniards \nencountered them in the sixteenth century. Although the Incas had no writing system \nof their own, historical information about the Incas is available to researchers \nbecause early Spaniards wrote documents about them. However, there are \ndrawbacks to using the written record. First, the Spanish writers were describing \nactivities and institutions that were very different from their own, but they often \ndescribed Inca culture in terms of their own society. As an example, consider the list \nof kings given by the Incas. As presented in the historical chronology, Spanish \nsources indicate there were thirteen kings who ruled sequentially. The names were \ngiven to them by Inca informants. However, one school of thought in Inca studies \nsuggests that the names were not actual people, but, rather, titles filled by different \nindividuals. Thus, the number of actual kings may have been fewer, and several titles \nmay have been filled at the same time. The early Spanish writers, being unfamiliar \nwith such a system of titles, simply translated it into something they were familiar \nwith (a succession of kings). Given that the Inca empire expanded only during the \ntime of the last four kings, or as a result of the actions of the individuals in those four \npositions, this question is not deemed significant for an understanding of the Incas. \nBut the example shows that biases and inaccuracies may have been introduced \ninadvertently from the very beginning of the written Spanish reports about the Incas. \nMoreover, early writers often copied information from each other—so misinformation \nwas likely to be passed on and accepted as true by later scholars. \nSecond, both Spanish writers and Inca informants sometimes had motives for being \ndeliberately deceitful. For example, in an effort to gain status in the Spaniards' eyes, \nIncas might say that they formerly had been more important in the Inca empire than \nthey actually were. Spanish officials as well were occasionally untruthful when it \nserved their purposes. For example, Spaniards might deliberately underreport the \nproductivity of a region under their authority so they could sell the additional products \nand keep the money, rather than hand it over to the Spanish Crown. \nThird, it should be noted that the Spaniards' main sources of information were the \nIncas themselves, often members of the Inca ruling class. Therefore, what was \nrecorded was the Incas' point of view about their own history and empire. Some \nmodern authorities question whether the history of the Incas happened as they said \nit did. Although some of their history is certainly more myth than truth, many, if not \nmost, scholars agree that the history of the last four Inca kings is probably accurate. \nThe same is true of other things told to the Spanish writers: the more recently an \nevent is said to have occurred, the more likely it is to have actually happened. \nA fourth problem relates to the nature of the Inca conquests of the other people in \nthe Americas before the Spanish arrived and how accurate the accounts of those \nconquests are—whether related by the Spaniards or by the Incas on whom they \nrelied. It was certainly in the Incas' interest to describe themselves as invincible and \njust. However, lacking accounts by conquered people about their interactions with \nthe Incas, it is unknown how much of the information of the Inca conquest as related \nby the ruling class is factual. \nFinally, there is a certain vagueness in the historical record regarding places and \nnames. Many Spanish writers listed places they had visited within the empire, \nincluding both provinces and towns. However, other writers traveling along the same \nroutes sometimes recounted different lists of places. In addition, it is difficult to \nidentify the exact locations of towns and other geographic points of reference \nbecause of the widespread movements of people over the past five centuries. \nFor all these reasons, the historical record must be carefully evaluated to determine \nwhether it is accurate and to verify the locations of past events. One approach is to \ncross-check information from a number of authors. Another approach is to conduct \narchaeological research. Regardless of the problems, historical documents reveal \nsome important information about the Incas.",

      "content": "On the basis of available evidence, there existed in ancient state-level societies a \nvariety of urban types. These have been classified under a number of different \nheadings, ranging from city-states to territorial- or village-states. Mesopotamia and \nEgypt, for example, traditionally represent the two opposing extremes along a \nspectrum of possible settlement distributions and types. \nMesopotamian city-state systems were made up of densely populated urban areas \nthat shared a common language, status symbols, and economic systems, but their \nelites tended to compete with each other, often militarily, to control territory, trade \nroutes, and other resources. Each city-state controlled a relatively small territory, \noften only a few hundred square kilometers, and had its own capital city, which in \nmany cases was enclosed by a wall. In addition to its capital, a city-state might \ngovern a number of smaller centers, as well as numerous farming villages and \nhamlets. Ancient Sumer is a classic example of such a system. \nIn ancient Mesopotamia, urban centers tended to be relatively large, with populations \nranging from less than 1,000 to more than 100,000 inhabitants, depending on the \nability of a particular city-state to control and collect payments from its neighbors. \nOften, a considerable number of farmers lived in these centers to secure greater \nprotection for themselves and their possessions. It is estimated that in southern \nMesopotamia (circa 2900-2350 B.C.) more than 80 percent of the total population \nlived in cities. \nThese cities also supported craft production, which sought to satisfy the demands of \nthe urban elite and society as a whole. The development of craft specialization and \ncommercial exchanges between town and countryside as well as between \nneighboring urban centers encouraged the growth of public markets. Although the \nevidence for actual marketplaces is less than clear for southern Mesopotamia, the \nremnants of shop-lined streets indicate vigorous commercial activity involving large \nnumbers of people. This activity in turn promoted competition among city-states to \nobtain supplies of exotic raw materials. As a result of widespread access to goods \nproduced by full-time specialists and the development of more intensive agriculture \nclose to urban centers, Mesopotamian city-states were able to support numerous \nnonfood producers, possibly as high a proportion as 20 percent of the total \npopulation. \nIn contrast to Mesopotamia, ancient Egypt's population has traditionally been \nperceived as more evenly dispersed across the landscape, a characteristic of \nvillage-states. Topography and the formation of the early state were the major factors \ncontributing to this dispersal. Unlike Mesopotamia, Egypt had relatively secure and \ndefined borders, allowing a single state to dominate the area. Additionally, the \nvillages and towns of Egypt, all of which were situated near the Nile on the river's \nnarrow flood plain, had approximately equal access to the river and did not have to \ncompete among themselves for water as their contemporaries in Mesopotamia were \nforced to do. As the main highway through Egypt, the Nile offered innumerable \nharbors for shipping and trading, so there was no strong locational advantage to be \ngained in one area as opposed to another; hence the Egyptian population generally \nremained dispersed throughout the valley and delta in low densities. Trade \nspecialists apparently were evenly spread throughout Egypt, supported by both \nindependent workshops in small towns and royal patronage in the territorial capitals. \nIn contrast to the defensive walls of Mesopotamian city-states, the walls of Egyptian \ntowns primarily defined and delineated sections of the town (for example, a temple \nprecinct from a residential area). \nEgypt, however, was not without urban centers. At points where goods entered the \nNile valley via maritime routes or overland routes from the Red Sea via wadis \n(stream beds that remain dry except during the rainy season), the right \ncircumstances existed for the growth of larger cities. Egyptian cities and towns \nshared certain characteristics with other contemporary societies but also displayed \nunique traits influenced by the culture and environment of the Nile valley. Thus, the \ngeopolitical system that evolved in ancient Egypt was different from that of \nMesopotamia; Egypt developed a village or territorial state characterized by \ndispersed settlements of varying size, a form of urbanism that gave Egypt its \ndistinctive identity.",

      "title": "The Collapse of the Maya",
      "content": "The Mayan society of Central America (2000 B.C.- A.D. 1500), like other ancient \nstates, was characterized by populations unprecedented both in their size and \ndensity. It was not just the number of people that lived in the Mayan city-states but \nalso the relatively small area into which they were concentrated. To support such \npopulations, societies developed various intensive agricultural techniques including \nlarge-scale irrigation and hill-slope terracing (the cutting of horizontal ridges into \nhillsides so they can be farmed). These were designed both to increase yields from a \ngiven area and to increase the absolute amount of land under cultivation. These \nstrategies were in essence very successful: they made it possible to feed larger \npopulations than ever before and supported the growth of cities. But they also placed \nconsiderable strains on the environment and rendered it increasingly fragile and \nvulnerable to unexpected climatic events, and even to short-term fluctuations. Thus, \nthe argument is that because of their size and ever more intensive agriculture, the \nMayan and other ancient state societies were fundamentally unsustainable. \nClaims about environmental degradation and disaster have figured prominently in \ndiscussions of the collapse of the Mayan city-states of the Central American \nlowlands. When two explorers came upon the Mayan cities in the 1830s, they were \nstruck by the sight of tall pyramids and elaborately carved stones among luxuriant \nforest growth. Here was the archetypal picture of a great lost civilization: abandoned \ncities submerged in vegetation. Theories of catastrophic collapse or apocalyptic \noverthrow came naturally to mind to explain these dramatic scenes. \nRecent studies of the Mayan collapse (beginning around A.D. 900) have emphasized \nthe gradual and progressive nature of the process, beginning earliest in the South \nand advancing northward. It was not a single, sudden event, as had once been \nthought. Warfare and social unrest are thought to have played a part, but these may \nwell have arisen through pressure from other causes. The Mayan cities had, after all, \nflourished for over 500 years and had frequently been at war with each other. \nBut what about the possibility of food shortage? These could have come about \nthrough either natural or humanly induced changes in the environment. Increasingly \nfierce competition between Mayan cities led to an upsurge of monument construction \nduring the eighth and ninth centuries A.D., which would have placed added strain on \nagricultural production and expansion. Interstate rivalry may hence have pushed the \nMaya toward overexploitation of their fragile ecosystem. Deforestation and soil \nerosion might ultimately have destroyed the capacity of the land to support the high \npopulation levels of the Mayan cities, leading to famine, social unrest, and the \ncollapse of the major Mayan centers. \nYet it may be incorrect to lay the blame entirely on human action. Several of the \nlowland cities, such as Tikal, appear to have depended heavily on the cultivation of \nraised fields set in the marshy depressions known as bajos, which today flood \nintermittently in the rainy season but may originally have been permanent lakes. The \nraised-field system of intensive cultivation (created by digging surrounding canals \nand using the soil removed to elevate the fields for planting) allows year-round food \nproduction through the constant supply of soil nutrients that erode into the drainage \nditches dug around the raised fields, nutrients that are then collected and replaced. \nStable water levels were essential to this subsistence system, but evidence from \nLake Chichancanab in Yucatan shows that between A.D. 800 and A.D. 1000 this \nregion suffered its driest period of climate in several thousand years. We may expect \nthat as a result water levels fell, and the raised fields in many areas became \nunusable. But the human response must be viewed through the lens of the social, \npolitical, and cultural circumstances. These exerted a powerful mediating effect on \nthe way the Maya endeavored to cope with their difficulties. Had population levels \nbeen lower, the impact of the drought may not have been catastrophic; as it was, the \nMaya were already reaching the limits of the available subsistence capacity, and \nMayan elites had espoused certain social and political agendas (including expensive \nwarfare and competition with each other). It was against this specific background \nthat a period of drought led quickly to crisis and collapse.",

      "content": "Starting around 8000 B.C.E., the most extensive exploitation of agriculture occurred \nin river valleys, where there were both good soil and a dependable water supply \nregardless of the amount of rainfall. In the Near East, this happened in the Fertile \nCrescent, the region extending up the Nile Valley in Egypt, north through the Levant \n(Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria), and southeast into the Tigris and Euphrates river \nvalleys of Mesopotamia. The richest soil was located in the deltas at the mouths of \nthe rivers, but the deltas were swampy and subject to flooding. Before they could be \nfarmed, they needed to be drained and irrigated, and flood-control systems had to be \nconstructed. These activities required administrative organization to mobilize large \npools of labor. In Mesopotamia, perhaps as a consequence of a period of drought, \nmassive land-use projects were undertaken after 4000 B.C.E. to cultivate the rich \ndelta soils of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. The land was so productive that many \nmore people could be fed, and a great population explosion resulted. Villages grew \ninto cities of tens of thousands of persons. \nThese large cities needed some form of centralized administration. Archaeological \nevidence indicates that the organization initially was provided by religion, for the \nlargest building in each city was a massive temple honoring one of the \nMesopotamian gods. In Uruk, for example, a 60-foot-long temple known as the White \nTemple was built before 3000 B.C.E. There were no other large public buildings, \nsuggesting that the priests who were in charge of the temples also were responsible \nfor governing the city and organizing people to work in the fields and on irrigation \nprojects—building and maintaining systems of ditches and dams. \nThe great concentration of wealth and resources in the river valleys brought with it \nfurther technological advances, such as wheeled vehicles, multicolored pottery and \nthe pottery wheel, and the weaving of wool garments. Advances in metal technology \njust before 2000 B.C.E. resulted in the creation of bronze, a durable alloy (or \nmixture) of about 90 percent copper and 10 percent tin that provided a sharp cutting \nedge for weapons. \nBy 3000 B.C.E., the economies and administrations of Mesopotamia and Egypt had \nbecome so complex that some form of record keeping was needed. As a result, \nwriting was invented. Once a society became literate, it passed from the period \nknown as prehistory into the historic period. In fact, the word \"history\" comes from a \nGreek word meaning \"narrative\"—people could not provide a detailed permanent \naccount of their past until they were able to write. \nThe totality of these developments resulted in the appearance, around 3000 B.C.E., \nof a new form of culture called civilization. The first civilizations had several defining \ncharacteristics. They had economies based on agriculture. They had cities that \nfunctioned as administrative centers and usually had large populations. They had \ndifferent social classes, such as free persons and slaves. They had specialization of \nlabor, that is, different people serving, for example, as rulers, priests, craft workers, \nmerchants, soldiers, and farmers. And they had metal technology and a system of \nwriting. As of 3000 B.C.E., civilization in these terms existed in Mesopotamia, Egypt, \nIndia, and China. \nThis first phase of civilization is called the Bronze Age because of the importance of \nmetal technology. The most characteristic Near Eastern Bronze Age civilizations, \nthose of Mesopotamia and Egypt, were located in river valleys, were based on the \nextensive exploitation of agriculture, and supported large populations. Bronze was a \nvaluable commodity in these civilizations; the copper and tin needed for its \nmanufacture did not exist in river valleys and had to be imported. Bronze was \ntherefore used mainly for luxury items, such as jewelry or weapons, not for everyday \ndomestic items, which were made from pottery, animal products, wood, and stone. In \nparticular, bronze was not used for farming tools. Thus, early civilizations based on \nlarge-scale agriculture, such as those of Mesopotamia and Egypt, were feasible only \nin soils that could be worked by wooden plows pulled by people or draft animals \nsuch as oxen. Other Bronze Age civilizations, however, such as those that arose in \nthe Levant and eastern Mediterranean, took advantage of their location on \ncommunication routes to pursue economies based on trade.",

      "content": "In a work published in 1972, Professor Colin Renfrew approached the problem from \na different viewpoint. He argued that the scanty available evidence for invasion or \nimmigration from Anatolia into Greece in the early Bronze Age (about 3300-2200 \nB.C.E.) showed that, at most, such incursion was limited, and that it could not be \nregarded as responsible for the transformation of society there. Trade, though clearly \ndocumented, was also an inadequate explanation in itself. To understand the major \nchanges in social organization and complexity that took place, it was necessary, said \nRenfrew, to determine the impact that new variables emerging in the early Bronze \nAge may have had on every interrelated aspect of the local social system. The two \nnew major developments he considered were changes in the subsistence economy \nand the introduction of metallurgy. \nIn the early Bronze Age, Renfrew argued, the Greek economy was transformed by \ntwo important innovations: the cultivation of the vine for wine and the olive for oil. \nUnlike grain, which can be grown almost anywhere, vines and olives require specific \nconditions and take several years to become productive. Their cultivation \nencourages long-term investment in land and the development of trade networks to \ndistribute their products. Olive oil, in particular, became a valuable commodity, used \nfor cooking, lighting, cosmetics, and religious rituals. The need to produce and \ndistribute these new products stimulated economic growth and social change. \nAt the same time, the introduction of metallurgy, specifically the production of bronze, \nhad far-reaching effects. The raw materials—copper and tin—were scarce and had \nto be obtained through trade. This stimulated long-distance exchange networks and \ncreated new opportunities for wealth and status. The new metal tools and weapons \nwere more efficient than their stone predecessors, increasing agricultural productivity \nand military power. The demand for metalwork stimulated further specialization in \ncrafts such as toolmaking and jewelry making. The new tools promoted the \ndevelopment of other crafts, like carpentry and shipbuilding. \nSome copper artifacts were made during the fourth millennium B.C.E., but there \nwere not many of them and they had little economic or social significance. When, in \nthe third millennium, copper began to be mixed with tin to produce the relatively hard \nalloy bronze, demand for metal goods grew. Bronze could be used to make a range \nof useful new tools and weapons and a variety of impressive ornaments. The \ndemand for metalwork stimulated further specialization in crafts such as toolmaking \nand jewelry making. The new tools promoted the development of other crafts, like \ncarpentry and shipbuilding. Competition for prestigious or useful craft products and \nfor control of their producers helped to heighten both social differences within \ncommunities and conflicts between them, resulting in the emergence of local \nchieftains, who were also in many instances warriors. These chieftains regulated \nagricultural and craft production, operating a distribution system through which the \nfarmers could obtain tools or ornaments they needed or wanted. The organizational \ndemands of controlled distribution made it necessary to develop methods of \nmeasurement and recording, which led to the development of writing. \nRenfrew argued that any single innovation would have had a limited or negligible \neffect on social organization because the inherently conservative nature of societies \nacts to minimize change. However, the interaction of several simultaneous \ndevelopments created a multiplier effect. In the Aegean, increased agricultural \nproductivity provided the means to support craft specialization, while bronze \nmetallurgy provided the technology for producing highly valued new products. These \nfactors set in motion a series of changes in other subsystems of society. Those \nchanges in turn resulted in what, in a term borrowed from electronics, are called \npositive feedback loops—alterations in the workings of a social system that serve to \nreinforce themselves. Thus, Aegean society was transformed from one consisting of \nbasically self-sufficient and egalitarian farming villages to one of prosperous, \nhierarchical chiefdoms, with palace-dwelling rulers, actively competing with one \nanother both at home and in international trade.",

      "title": "The Western Roman Empire in the Fifth Century",
      "content": "Shortly after the death of emperor Theodosius in 395 A.D., the Roman Empire was \npermanently divided into Eastern and Western empires. By the fifth century A.D., the \npower of the Western Roman Empire had declined considerably, though the Eastern \nRoman Empire centered in Byzantium continued to flourish. Various problems \ncontributed to this undermining of the West. \nThe accessions of Arcadius and Honorius, sons of Theodosius, as emperors in the \nEast and West, respectively, illustrate the unfortunate pattern of child heirs that had \nunfavorable effects for both empires. When Arcadius died in 408, he was succeeded \nby his seven-year-old son, Theodosius II. Reigning until 423, Honorius was \nsucceeded by his nephew Valentinian III, who was only five. Because of their young \nages, Theodosius' sons and grandsons could not rule without older advisors and \nsupervising regents upon whom they naturally became dependent and from whom \nthey were unable to break away after reaching maturity. As powerful individuals vied \nfor influence and dominance at court, the general welfare was often sacrificed to \nprivate rivalries and ambitions. Moreover, it was the women of the dynasty who were \nthe more capable and interesting characters. Holding the keys to succession through \nbirth and inheritance, they became active players in the political arena. \nCompared with the East, however, the West faced a greater number of external \nthreats along more permeable frontiers. Whereas the East could pursue war and \ndiplomacy more effectively with their enemies on the long eastern frontier, the West \nwas exposed to the more volatile tribal Germanic peoples on a frontier that stretched \nalong the Rhine and Danube rivers for 1,000 miles. The East, however, only had to \nguard the last 500 miles of the Danube. In addition, the East had many more human \nand material resources with which to pursue its military and diplomatic objectives. \nThe East also had a more deeply rooted unity in the Greek culture of the numerous \nGreek and Near Eastern cities that Rome had inherited from earlier Grecian empires. \nLatin culture had not achieved comparable penetration of the less urbanized West \noutside of Italy. The penetration of Germanic culture from the north had been so \nextensive along the permeable Rhine-Danube frontier that it was often difficult to \ndistinguish between barbarians (speakers of German and other languages unrelated \nto Latin) and Romans in those regions by the fifth century anyway. \nOne of the most outstanding features at the beginning of this period was the \nprominence of Germanic generals in the high command of the Roman Imperial army. \nThe trend became significant, and several practical reasons can explain it. The \nforemost probably was the sheer need for military manpower that made it attractive \nto recruit bands of Germanic peoples for the armies, which, in turn, gave chieftains \nand warlords the opportunity to gain Imperial favor and advance in rank. Second, \none way to turn Germanic chieftains from potential enemies into loyal supporters \nwas to offer them a good position in the Roman military. Third, although Theodosius \nhad risen to power as a military leader, he was also a cultured aristocrat and \npreferred to emphasize the civilian role of the emperor and to rely for protection on \nGermanic generals whose loyalties were primarily to him, their patron. \nUnfortunately, the high positions achieved by Germanic officers often aroused the \njealousy and hostility of high-ranking Roman military and civilian officials. Such \npositions also gave their Germanic holders a chance to act on both personal and \ntribal animosities in the arena of Imperial politics. Internal Roman rivalries and power \nstruggles aggravated the situation. Rival factional leaders often granted Imperial \ntitles and conceded territory to one Germanic leader or another in return for help \nagainst fellow Romans. While the Romans were thus distracted by internal conflict, \nother tribes seized the opportunity to cross into Roman territory unopposed. When \nthe Romans could not dislodge them, peace was bought with further titles and \nterritorial concessions as allies. In the midst of it all, alliances and coalitions between \nRoman emperors or powerful commanders and various tribes or tribal kings were \nmade, unmade, and remade so often that it is nearly impossible to follow their \ncourse. Accordingly, all of these situations proved dangerous to the peace and safety \nof the West.",

      "title": "Newspaper in Western Europe",
      "content": "By the eighteenth century, newspapers had become firmly established as a means of \nspreading news of European and world affairs, as well as of local concerns, within \nEuropean society. One of the first true newspapers was the Dutch paper Nieuwe \nTijdingen. It began publication in the early seventeenth century at about the same \ntime that the overseas trading company called the Dutch East India Company was \nformed. The same ships that brought goods back from abroad brought news of the \nworld, too. \nDutch publishers had an advantage over many other publishers around Europe \nbecause the Netherlands' highly decentralized political system made its censorship \nlaws very difficult to enforce. Throughout Europe in the seventeenth century, \ngovernments began recognizing the revolutionary potential of the free press and \nbegan requiring licenses of newspapers—to control who was able to publish news. \nAnother tactic, in France and elsewhere on the continent from the 1630s onward, \nwas for governments to sponsor official newspapers. These state publications met \nthe increasing demand for news but always supported the government's views of the \nevents of the day. \nBy the eighteenth century, new conditions allowed newspapers to flourish as never \nbefore. First, demand for news increased as Europe's commercial and political \ninterests spread around the globe—merchants in London, Liverpool, or Glasgow, for \nexample, came to depend on early news of Caribbean harvests and gains and \nlosses in colonial wars. Europe's growing commercial strength also increased \ndistribution networks for newspapers. There were more and better roads, and more \nvehicles could deliver newspapers in cities and convey them to outlying towns. \nNewspaper publishers made use of the many new sites where the public expected to \nread, as newspapers were delivered to cafes and sold or delivered by booksellers. \nSecond, many European states had established effective postal systems by the \neighteenth century. It was through the mail that readers outside major cities and their \nenvirons—and virtually all readers in areas where press censorship was exercised \nfirmly—received their newspapers. One of the most successful newspapers in \nEurope was a French-language paper (one of the many known as La Gazette) \npublished in Leiden, in the Netherlands, which boasted a wide readership in France \nand among elites throughout Europe. \nFinally, press censorship faltered in one of the most important markets for \nnews—England—at the turn of the eighteenth century after 1688. Debate raged \nabout whether the Parliament or the Crown had the right to control the press, and in \nthe confusion the press flourished. The emergence of political parties further \nhampered control of the press because political decisions in Parliament now always \ninvolved compromise, and many members believed that an active press was useful \nto that process. The British government's control of the press was reduced to taxing \nnewspapers, a tactic that drove some papers out of business. \nEighteenth-century newspapers were modest products by modern Western \nstandards. Many were published only once or twice a week instead of every day, in \neditions of only a few thousand copies. Each newspaper was generally only four \npages long. Illustrations were rare, and headlines had not yet been invented. \nHand-operated wooden presses were used to print the papers, just as they had been \nused to print pamphlets and books since the invention of printing in the fifteenth \ncentury. \nYet these newspapers had a dramatic impact on their reading public. Regular \nproduction of newspapers (especially of many competing newspapers) meant that \nnews was presented to the public at regular intervals and in manageable amounts. \nEven strange and threatening news from around the world became increasingly easy \nfor readers to absorb and interpret. Newspaper readers also felt themselves part of \nthe public life about which they were reading. This was true partly because \nnewspapers, available in public reading rooms and in cafes, were one kind of \nreading that occupied an increasingly self-aware and literate audience. Newspapers \nalso were uniquely responsive to their readers. They began to carry advertisements, \nwhich both produced revenue for papers and widened readers' exposure to their own \ncommunities. Even more important was the inauguration of letters to the editor in \nwhich readers expressed their opinions about events. Newspapers thus became \nvenues for the often rapid exchange of news and opinions.",

      "title": "Effects of the Commercial Revolution",
      "content": "In the third and the second millennia B.C., long-distance trade supposedly had the \ncharacter of an expedition. By the start of the last millennium B.C., however, a new \napproach to engaging in such trade emerged. Based on the principle of colonization, \nit was pioneered by the Phoenicians and Greeks, who established colonies along the \nMediterranean Sea. The new approach to long-distance trade, known as the \ncommercial revolution, led to changes in a number of political and economic \npatterns. \nFor the first time, the planting of colonies in distant lands became possible. The \nPhoenician settlements in the central and western Mediterranean, such as Carthage, \nand the slightly later establishment of Greek colonies are early examples, while the \nsettlement of south Arabians in Eritrea around the middle of the last millennium \nmarks the subsequent spread of this sort of commercial consequence to the Horn of \nAfrica. In the third or second millennia B.C., a state such as Egypt might colonize \nareas outside its heartland, such as Nubia. But this colonization comprised military \noutposts and ethnic settlements that were planted to hold the contiguous territories \nof a land empire, not distant localities far separated from the home country. \nThe commercial revolution constructed the economic basis as well for a new kind of \ntown or city, an urban center that above all serviced trade and was home to the \ncrafts and occupational specializations that went along with commercial \ndevelopment. The urban locations of earlier times commonly drew trade simply \nbecause their populations had included a privileged elite of potential consumers. \nSuch towns had arisen in the first place as political and religious centers of the \nsociety; they attracted population because power and influence reside there and \naccess to position and wealth could be gained through service to the royal or priestly \nleadership. \nWherever the effects of the commercial revolution penetrated over the last \nmillennium B.C., kings and emperors increasingly lost their ability to treat trade as a \nroyally sponsored activity, intended to preserve the commodities of trade as the \nprivileges of immemorial power and position. Instead, their policies shifted toward \ncontrolling geographical accessibility to the products of commerce and to ensuring \nsecurity and other conditions that attracted and enhanced the movement of goods. \nNo longer could kings rely on agriculturally supported and religiously based claims to \nan ability to protect their lands and people; now they also had to overtly support the \nmaterial prosperity of their people compared to other societies. And rather than \nexerting a monopoly over prestige commodities, as had Egyptian kings of the third \nand second millennia, and redistributing such commodities in ways designed to \nreinforce the allegiance of their subjects and enhance the awesomeness of their \nposition, rulers turned to the taxation of trade and to the creation and control of \ncurrency, more and more relying on duties and other revenues to support the \napparatus of the state. It was no historical accident that the first metal coinage in the \nworld began to be made in eighth-century Anatolia (modern Turkey) and that the use \nof coins rapidly spread with the expanding commercial revolution. The material \nbases and the legitimizations of state authority as we know them today had begun to \ntake shape. \nThe commercial revolution tended also to spread a particular pattern of exchange. \nThe early commercial centers of the Mediterranean most characteristically offered \nmanufactured goods—purple dye, metal goods, wine, olive oil, and so forth—for the \nraw materials or the partially processed natural products of other regions. As the \ncommercial revolution spread, this kind of exchange tended to spread with it, with \nthe recently added areas of commerce providing new kinds of raw materials or new \nsources for familiar products of the natural world, and the longer established \ncommercial centers—which might themselves have lain at the margins of this \ntransformation—producing, or acting as the intermediaries in the transmission of \nmanufactured commodities. India, for instance, had developed by the turn of the era \ninto a major exporter of its own cotton textiles, as well as naturally occurring \nmaterials, such as gems of various kinds, and at the same time its merchants were \nthe intermediaries of the silk trade.",

      "title": "European Context of the Scientific Revolution",
      "content": "The Scientific Revolution represents a turning point in world history. By 1700 \nEuropean scientists had overthrown the science and worldviews of the ancient \nphilosophers: Aristotle and Ptolemy. Europeans in 1700 lived in a vastly different \nintellectual world than that experienced by their predecessors in, say, 1500. The role \nand power of science, as a way of knowing about the world and as an agency with \nthe potential of changing the world, likewise underwent profound restructuring as \npart of the Scientific Revolution. \nThe social context for science in Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries \nhad changed in several dramatic ways from the Middle Ages (roughly, 500 C.E. to \nthe 1400s C.E.). Advances in military technology, the European voyages of \nexploration, and contact with the New World altered the context in which the \nScientific Revolution unfolded. The geographical discovery of the Americas generally \nundermined the closed Eurocentric cosmos of the later Middle Ages, and the science \nof geography provided a stimulus of its own to the Scientific Revolution. With an \nemphasis on observational reports and practical experience, new geographical \ndiscoveries challenged accepted knowledge. Cartography (mapmaking) thus \nprovided exemplary new ways of learning about the world in general, ways \nself-evidently superior to mastering established doctrines from dusty books. Many of \nthe scientists of the Scientific Revolution seem to have been involved in one fashion \nor another with geography or cartography. \nIn the late 1430s, Johannes Gutenberg, apparently independently of the \ndevelopment of woodblock printing in Asia, invented printing with movable type, and \nthe spread of this powerful new technology after 1450 likewise altered the cultural \nlandscape of early modern Europe. The new medium created a revolution in \ncommunications that increased the amount and accuracy of information available \nand made copying of books by scribes obsolete. Producing some 13,000 works by \n1500, printing presses spread rapidly throughout Europe and helped to break down \nthe monopoly of learning in universities and to create a new group of nonreligious \nintellectuals. Indeed, the first printshops became something of intellectual centers \nthemselves, with authors, publishers, and workers collaborating in unprecedented \nways in the production of new knowledge. Renaissance humanism, that renowned \nphilosophical and literary movement emphasizing human values and the direct study \nof classical Greek and Latin texts, is hardly conceivable without the technology of \nprinting that sustained the efforts of learned humanists. Regarding science, the \nadvent of printing and humanist scholarship brought another wave in the recovery of \nancient texts. Whereas Europeans first learned of ancient Greek science largely \nthrough translations from the Arabic in the twelfth century, in the later fifteenth \ncentury scholars brought forth new editions from Greek originals and uncovered \ninfluential new sources, notably the Greek mathematician Archimedes. Similarly, \nprinting disseminated previously obscure handbooks of technical and magical \nsecrets that proved influential in the developing Scientific Revolution. \nParticularly in Italy, the revival of cultural life and the arts in the late fourteenth and \nfifteenth centuries commonly known as the Renaissance must also be considered as \nan urban and comparatively secular phenomenon, aligned with courts and courtly \npatronage but not with the universities, which were religiously based. One associates \nthe great flourish of artistic activity of the Renaissance with such talents as \nDonatello, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and Michelangelo. In comparison with \nmedieval art, the use of perspective—a projection system that realistically renders \nthe three dimensions of space onto the two dimensions of a canvas—represents a \nnew feature typical of Renaissance painting, and through the work of Leon Battista \nAlberti, Albrecht Dürer, and others, artists learned to practice mathematical rules \ngoverning perspective. So noteworthy was this development that historians have \nbeen inclined to place Renaissance artists at the forefront of those uncovering new \nknowledge about nature in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Whatever one may \nmake of that claim, early modern artists needed accurate knowledge of human \nmuscular anatomy for lifelike renditions, and an explosion of anatomical research in \nthe Renaissance may be attributed to this need in the artistic community.",

      "title": "Farming New England in Colonial Times",
      "content": "When in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries European settlers arrived in New \nEngland, the northeastern part of the United States, forest was the dominant form of \nvegetative cover, making agriculture difficult. Initially, the Europeans went in search \nof areas already cleared by Native Americans (the original inhabitants of the \ncontinent) that would be suitable for planting crops, to thereby save themselves from \nthe backbreaking labor involved in clearing forestland. \nEventually, however, population growth outstripped the supply of cleared land, \nforcing the European settlers to cut down more forest themselves. For most of the \nsettlers, cleared, arable land was the landscape most familiar to them from life back \nacross the ocean. It took time to become accustomed to the hard labor involved in \ncutting down the woods. In the northern colonies, trees were usually chopped down, \nalthough occasionally a technique known as girdling was used. Girdling, a practice \nfar more common in the South, involved cutting a horizontal channel all the way \naround the tree, which stopped the flow of sap, the liquid that carries food to all parts \nof a plant. Deprived of sap, the leaves would die and the branches eventually fell off, \nleaving the surrounding land dry and suitable for planting. \nNew Englanders, however, generally clear-cut the forest, in part because the \ndemand for fuel wood and lumber encouraged it. The market for potash, an alkaline \nsubstance that came from burning hardwood trees, also strongly motivated farmers \nto cut and burn the woods. Used to manufacture soap, glass, and gunpowder and to \nbleach linens and print calicoes, potash served a range of industrial uses but at the \nexpense of farms, which lost the nutrients that the wood ashes would otherwise have \nreleased back into the soil had they not been exported to market. \nWith their very existence dependent on the successful production of food, farmers \nhad little, if any, time for removing stumps and stones. Instead, they adapted to the \nhalf-cleared fields by planting corn (maize) and grass, both of which grew well in \nsuch an environment. A pattern of \"extensive\" farming began to emerge. Rather than \ncarefully tending arable land, engaging in crop rotation, manuring, and removing all \nstumps and stones—all recognized as part of proper agricultural practice in \nEurope—New England farmers simply exploited the soil and then forged ahead with \nthe clearing of new land. Cutting down trees remained hard work, but it was easier to \npartially clear the land, plant it, and then move on to another small plot than to \nconstantly improve the soil on one field to the high Old World (European) standards. \nThe settlers were too busy figuring out how to produce food rapidly to worry about \nefficient agricultural practices. \nEarly on, the settlers adopted the Native American practice of planting corn along \nwith beans and pumpkins or squash. These plants reinforced one another, resulting \nin high agricultural yields. The stalks of corn facilitated the growth of beans by giving \nthem a structure to climb. The beans replenished the nitrogen that the corn drained \nout of the soil, bolstering fertility. And the pumpkins were a valuable source of food in \nthe pioneer environment. After a few seasons, however, the settlers slowly began the \nprocess of transforming New England into an image of the Old World, planting \nEuropean grains such as wheat and rye alongside the maize, a crop they never \nabandoned, in part because it proved a more reliable source of food. \nNew England, unlike the South, did not center its economy on an export crop like \ntobacco. Nor were its soils as fertile as those in the mid-Atlantic area (south of New \nEngland), which by the eighteenth century was the great grain-producing region of \nthe colonies instead. New England's soil had a moisture content that made it \nespecially suited for growing grass. Grass played the pivotal role in the region's farm \necology: the grass fed cattle that, in turn, produced manure that was spread over the \nfields as fertilizer for growing corn and other crops. Grass and cattle thus helped to \nmaintain soil fertility—the key to reproducing a sustainable form of farm life—by \nrecycling nutrients back into the fields.",

      "title": "Population Revolution in Eighteenth-Century Europe",
      "content": "In late seventeenth-century Europe, what had been evolution in population followed \nby stabilization changed to population revolution. Increasing contacts with the \nAmericas brought more sophisticated knowledge of the advantages of new foods, \nparticularly the potato. Originally a cool-weather mountain crop in the Americas, \npotatoes did well in the Pyrenees, Alps, and Scottish Highlands. They also grew well \nin the long, damp springtime of the northwest European plain. Whatever hesitancy \npeasants may have felt about eating potatoes quickly passed when famine \nthreatened; after all, people who in famines desperately consumed grass, weeds, \nand the bark of trees hardly would have hesitated to eat a potato. By the later \neighteenth and the nineteenth century, American foods had become the principal \nfoodstuffs of many rural folk. Various agricultural publicists promoted adoption of \nthese foods, and peasants found that potatoes could allow subsistence on smaller \nplots of land. Fried potatoes soon began to be sold on the streets of Paris in the \n1680s, the original French fries. Governments, eager to promote population growth \nas a source of military and economic strength, also backed the potato. \nAlong with new foods, some landowners began to introduce other innovations. The \nnutritional base for a population revolution combined regional changes with the use \nof American foods. Dutch and English farmers drained more swamps and so \nincreased cultivable land. Agricultural reformers further promoted the use of crops \nsuch as the turnip that return valuable nitrogen to the soil. Improvements in available \ntools, such as growing use of the scythe instead of the sickle for harvesting, and \nbetter methods of raising livestock also spread. All this took shape from the late \nseventeenth century onward, building on earlier agricultural changes. At the same \ntime, rates of epidemic disease declined, in part because of more effective \ngovernment controls over the passage of people and animals along traditional \nplague routes from the Middle East. It was the change in foods that really counted, \nhowever. \nThese developments provided a framework for an unprecedented surge. In virtually \nevery area of Europe, the population increased by 50 to 100 percent in the \neighteenth century, with the greatest growth coming after 1750. The Hapsburg \nEmpire grew from 20 million to 27 million people; Spain rose from 5 million to 10 \nmillion, and Prussia rose from 3 million to 6 million. Growth would continue \nthroughout the nineteenth century. In Europe as a whole, population rose from 188 \nmillion in 1800 to 401 million in 1900. This was an upheaval of truly impressive \nproportions. \nThe population explosion resulted from a break in the traditional, if approximate, \nbalance between births and deaths in European society. In England between 1700 \nand 1750, approximately 32.8 people were born annually for every 1,000 inhabitants, \nand 31.5 people died. Similarly, in Lombardy in the eighteenth century, 39 people \nwere born and 37 people died for every 1,000 inhabitants. Clearly, a major alteration \nhad to occur in either the birth or the mortality rate before the expansion of \npopulation could begin. In fact, both rates changed: families began to have more \nchildren, and a lower percentage of the population died each year. Lower infant \ndeath rates meant more people living to produce children of their own, though falling \nadult death rates also increased the number of older Europeans. \nWhile historians continue to debate the precise balance of causes involved in these \ndramatic changes, basic outlines are clear. Better food and a reduction in the \nepidemic-disease cycle allowed more children to live to adulthood, which increased \nthe population directly and also provided more parents for the next generation, a \ndouble impact. Rapidly increasing populations provided a new labor force for \nmanufacturing. In the eighteenth century, this mainly involved hundreds of thousands \nof people, mostly rural, producing thread, cloth, and other products for market sale. \nThis manufacturing expansion helped sustain the growing population, but it could \nalso encourage a higher birth rate. Some people, able to earn money by their late \nteens, began to produce children earlier; the rate of illegitimate births went up. \nOthers realized that having an extra child or two might help the family economy by \nproviding additional worker-assistants. While death-rate decline was the most \nimportant source of Europe's population explosion, various changes on the birth rate \nside, though quite short-lived, pushed the population up as well.",

      "title": "The British Economy under the Roman Empire",
      "content": "Following the Roman Empire conquering the area in the first century A.D., there is a \ngreat deal of archaeological evidence for the economic growth of the British Isles. \nPrior to this event, the economy of the British Isles, which was based on \nmanufacturing, was centered mainly on the household and on craft skills, and the \nbest quality and greatest range of goods were largely a monopoly of the tribal \naristocracies. This was the nature of the economy which lasted in regions of Britain \nthat were unconquered by the Roman Empire, even though some Roman products \nwere utilized in such areas. The majority of these Roman artifacts were glass \nvessels, pots, as well as small metal objects that were dispersed over a vast region. \nThey perhaps held a symbolic value and were not necessarily used for their \noriginally designed purposes. The spread of Roman objects beyond Roman Britain \ndoes not seem to have happened on an enormous scale. In areas where artifacts \nare more numerous, it is likely due to gift giving during close interactions between \nthe Roman government and the tribes. \nIn regions that experienced direct economic control under the Romans, however, \neconomic growth is clearly notable. There was an enormous increase in the number \nand variety of goods in circulation and the range of settlements in which they were \nfound. This is clearly true in the overwhelming majority of excavated sites in Roman \nBritain, with the only exceptions being some rural regions that continued the \npre-Roman, Iron Age pattern. The majority of sites resulted in the discovery of an \nabundance of iron, glass, and pottery, and good quantities of copper alloys, lead, tin, \nsilver, and occasionally gold. For example, the humble iron nail is found in numbers \nnot repeated until the Industrial Revolution. \nThe technology levels and range of the manufacturing of these objects also \ndeveloped alongside the sheer increase in their quantity. During the Iron Age, the \ntypical household objects were usually manufactured using a low technology of craft \nmanufacture. Later, this changed to more specialized and larger-scale production \nmethods. During this time, specialized workers could utilize equipment manufactured \nthrough time and resource investments. In these regions, small scale workshops \nused by specialized craftsmen betoken full-time employment in this work. \nRegardless of the large increase in the scale of manufacturing, there is little \nevidence of major growth in the size of productive units. We are left with the \nimpression of an economy still based on small-scale craft production. \nWhere we do see an important change is in the removal of any exclusive association \nbetween the best traditional craftsmen and the governing elite. The powerful could \nshow off their status in new ways, particularly by using Roman architecture and \ndomestic decoration, but the traditional classes of decorative metalwork manufacture \nno longer seem to have been under the control of the tribal leaders. Rich objects \nfrom a wide range of archaeological sites imply the deterioration of this monopoly. \nThere are a number of contributing factors. The control of precious metals moved to \nthe imperial government immediately after the conquest, and gold and silver were \nalso removed from circulation when captured as booty during the invasion. Similarly, \nchanges in taste and the fashions of wealth and status display were stimulated by \nthe arrival of new things like Roman dress, architecture, and sculpture. \nThese changes in manufacture were accompanied by increased distances over \nwhich many goods were transported to their consumers. The bulk of pottery and \nother items originated locally during the Iron Age; but after the Roman invasion, \nthese objects had been produced over a far greater range of distances. In this way, \nvast regions of the Roman province were incorporated into a society where there \nwas wide access to material wealth. New changes in manufacturing production were \ncoupled with a huge increase in the importation of goods from elsewhere in the \nempire. These commodities, which included Mediterranean foodstuffs such as olive \noil as well as comparatively low-value objects such as decorated pottery, also \nachieved a wide distribution and are found in many different types of site.",

Major finds of this kind are still being made—for example, \nat the ancient city of Ebla (Tell Mardikh) in Syria, where an archive of 5,000 clay \ntablets written in an early dialect of Akkadian (Babylonian) was discovered in the \n1970s. \nIn each early literate society, writing had its own function and purpose. For instance, \nthe clay tablets of Mycenaean Greece, dating from around 1200 B.C., were all, \nwithout exception, primarily records of commercial transactions (goods coming in or \ngoing out) at the Mycenaean palaces. This discovery gives us an impression of \nmany aspects of the Mycenaean economy and a glimpse into craft organization \n(through the names for the different kinds of craftspeople), as well as an introduction \nto the names of the offices of state. But here, as in other cases, accidents of \npreservation may be important. It could be that the Mycenaeans wrote on clay only \nfor their commercial records and used other perishable materials for literary or \nhistorical texts now lost to us. It is certainly true that for the Classical Greek and \nRoman civilizations, it is mainly official decrees inscribed on marble that have \nsurvived. Fragile rolls of papyrus—the predecessor of modern paper—with literary \ntexts on them, have usually remained intact only when retained in the dry air of \nEgypt, or when buried beneath the volcanic ash covering Pompeii. \nCoins also provide a valuable source of written records: they can reveal information \nabout the location where they are found, which can provide evidence about trade \npractices there, and their inscriptions can be informative about the issuing authority, \nwhether they were city-states (as in ancient Greece) or sole rulers (as in Imperial \nRome or in the kingdoms of medieval Europe). \nIn recent years, one of the most significant advances in Mesoamerican archaeology \nhas come from deciphering many of the inscribed symbols (glyphs) on the stone \nstelae (pillars or columns) at the largest centers. It had been widely assumed that the \ninscriptions were exclusively of a calendrical nature or that they dealt with purely \nreligious matters, notably the deeds of the gods. But the inscriptions can now in \nmany cases be interpreted as relating to real historical events, mainly the deeds of \nthe Maya kings. We can now also begin to deduce the likely territories belonging to \nindividual Maya centers. Maya history has thus taken on a new dimension. \nWritten records undoubtedly contribute greatly to our knowledge of the society in \nquestion. But one should not accept them uncritically at face value. Nor should one \nforget the bias introduced by the accidents of preservation and the particular uses of \nliteracy in a society. The great risk with historical records is that they can impose \ntheir own perspective so that they begin not only to supply the answers to our \nquestions but subtly to determine the nature of those questions and even our \nconcepts and terminology. A good example is the question of kingship in \nAnglo-Saxon England. Most anthropologists and historians tend to think of a king as \nthe leader of a state society. Therefore, when the earliest records for Anglo-Saxon \nEngland, found in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which took final shape in about A.D. \n1155, refer to kings around A.D. 500, it is easy for the historian to think of kings and \nstates at that period. But the archaeology strongly suggests that a full state society \ndid not emerge until the time of King Offa of Mercia in around A.D. 780, or perhaps \nKing Alfred of Wessex in A.D. 871. It is fairly clear that the earlier so-called kings \nwere generally less significant figures than some of the rulers in either Africa or \nPolynesia in recent times, whom anthropologists would term \"chiefs.\"",
